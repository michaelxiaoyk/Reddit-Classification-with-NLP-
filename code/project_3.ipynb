       "   'selftext': \"Lung cancer, stage three, inoperable. Those were the words that spelled out my ultimate fate, and while it wouldn’t be a particularly original way to die, the irony wasn’t lost on me. \\n\\n\\nI’d never touched a cigarette during my short lifespan, despite growing up in a household where pretty much everyone inhaled those toxic fumes, including my own parents. Of course, they are both alive and healthy, even to this day they never suffered any consequences for any of their unhealthy habits, not even a dent put in their lung capacity. \\n\\n\\nDestiny truly is a fickle bitch…\\n\\n\\nThere I sat at the doctor’s office, speechless after hearing the diagnosis. I’d just gone in for a persistent cough, from what I thought would be nothing more than a common cold. In all honesty, I didn’t feel that sick, but my wife had convinced me to go for a checkup regardless, and because of that checkup, I’d just been told that in less than a year, I would be dead.\\n\\n\\nI’ve never been much of a religious person. If asked, I’d put myself somewhere on the agnostic spectrum of not knowing what the hell is going on. That being said, I didn’t fear death; I had spent one too many nights thinking about my eventual departure from this world, and had accepted that life was a precious resource that would inevitably expire.\\n\\n\\nI just didn’t think it would be so soon. \\n\\n\\nMy one true quarrel with death was leaving my family behind, at the not so, ripe old age of forty-two, I still hadn’t saved up enough money to keep us afloat in case of emergency, and while my wife still worked, neither of us made enough to support a child on our own, and it just so happened we had a ten year old son together. \\n\\n\\nThat’s why I started praying, begging, bargaining for a second chance. Each night I tried a different God, desperately looking for otherworldly answers regardless of religion or relevance in modern society. \\n\\n\\nI was desperate. \\n\\n\\nThe doctors offered a combo-treatment of radiation and chemotherapy. Of course, none would extend my life in any meaningful way, but I started the treatment nonetheless, hoping that maybe someone could offer a miracle cure. \\n\\n\\nBut, of course, my hopes were left unanswered…\\n\\n\\nIn the beginning of this year, my body had deteriorated to the point where I was nothing but a loose sack of skin draped over a malformed set of bones. I knew I only had a few weeks left before the cancer that had gestated within me, growing with each passing day, finally won the battle. \\n\\n\\nWhen breathing became little more than an agonising chore, serving only to initiate a cascade of painful coughs, I ended up bedridden next to an oxygen tank.  \\n\\n\\nThen, finally, on July 29th, 2019, as I tried to get dressed and make the short journey from my bed to the little breakfast table down the hall in my hospital, everything suddenly disappeared beneath my feet. \\n\\n\\nI started falling…\\n\\n\\nOne second I was traversing the hospital hallway, oxygen tank dragging on behind me, and with a final gasp, my pain was simply erased from existence. The memory of my disease was nothing more than a faint dream, and my life became a part of a very distant past.\\n\\n\\nI had died, I realised that much, but the concepts of life and death themselves meant little to me in the grand scheme of things. Yes, I had been a part of society on earth, a note in the everlasting symphony of life, but my part had passed and the song continued on without me, while I moved on to the next stage.\\n\\n\\nI floated, or sank, it was hard to tell directions apart in my new, weightless state. It almost seemed like an ocean. The deep blue hues surrounding me on all sides with bubbles of flickering light floating by, delightfully circling around me as I moved towards the brightest thing I’d ever seen.\\n\\n\\nThough the light was blinding, I could sense other beings surrounding me. I turned to look at them, squinting my eyes to get a better grasp of what they were. They didn’t resemble any creature ever walking upon earth’s surface, but I could tell they had once been human just like myself. They were happy, smiling without having faces, voicelessly laughing. \\n\\n\\nI waved at them, and they greeted me using nothing more than the warmth of their souls. I still had my body, not yet processed by the afterlife, but I felt healthy, no longer ravaged by the tumours within my chest. \\n\\n\\nOnce I got close enough to feel the heat of the light, my periphery darkened, and the joyful creatures dancing around me had been replaced by shadows staring intently at my passing. \\n\\n\\nThe new creatures weren’t people, but beings emitting the most dreadful sense of sadness and anger. They hated me for being able to touch the light, while they were forever trapped in the shadows. \\n\\n\\nOne of them reached out for me, its arms stretching impossibly far beyond its confinement. It grabbed onto my leg, pitch black nails digging deep into my flesh, tearing muscles from bone as I silently cried in agony. \\n\\n\\nBefore I could get a grasp of my situation, another pair of hands grabbed my arm, tearing it straight from its socket. A third pair wrapped around my chest, digging deep into my lungs, rummaging around where the tumours had once lived.\\n\\n\\nMore hands joined in, and before long, I was enveloped by hundreds of shadows, all tearing away at my limbs and organs, but as all meat was stripped from my body, the hands had nothing more to hold onto, and I was let go. \\n\\n\\nI was jolted awake, back in the hospital, gasping pathetically for air as the cancer once more inhabited most of my lung tissue. \\n\\n\\nMy family stood close by, sobbing at my demise. I really had died, but only for about a minute. \\n\\n\\nSilence quickly filled the room as they noticed I was still alive, doctors wearing shocked expressions and horrified stares from my son. They were surprised, confused, as no attempt had been made to resuscitate me. My death had been expected for so long that keeping me alive would be nothing more than a cruel joke.\\n\\n\\nYet, once again, I lived. I had been so close to eternal salvation, but something had pulled me away, denied my entrance to whatever lay beyond.\\n\\n\\nOf course, with the cancer relentlessly spreading throughout my body, I wasn’t meant to stay. Despite the bittersweet taste of my revival, the locals hailed it as a miracle, and multiple news stations wanted to share my story, profit from it; I promptly declined. I didn’t want to tell anyone what I saw on the other side, and I was in too much pain to accept it as a miracle. \\n\\n\\nAs I stabilised, they moved me to a hospice care facility. Death was still lingering around the corner, but they said I might have a couple of more weeks to spend with my family if nothing more. They’d already said goodbye once, and now that cruel trick of nature made them do it twice. \\n\\n\\nMy wife didn’t smile once in the following days. She wore a tired expression on her face, her eyes were sunken, but I couldn’t blame her. Taking care of a dying man is no easy task, much less for someone that has to do it twice. My son, on the other hand, would not stop crying, he was too young to understand, but he knew I wouldn’t stay for much longer. \\n\\n\\nTwo weeks came and went in the blink of an eye, each day spent in misery, dreading what awaited on the other side. \\n\\n\\nThen, one morning, I simply didn’t wake up…\\n\\n\\nOnce again, the world was done with me. I had been tossed away from existence, and just like before I started falling through time and space, into an infinite void. \\n\\n\\nThe shapeless beings still floated in the peripheries, lights that once wandered the earth, but this time, there were no smiles to greet me, no joy filling my soul to the brim. \\n\\n\\nThey were angry at me, I had returned to a place I didn’t belong, and now my journey was one no longer welcome.\\n\\n\\nI was pushed further towards the light, away from the once blissful companions, and it wasn’t long before I saw the shadows again. \\n\\n\\nThere the light lingered, just out of reach, so close I could almost touch it, when a pair of twisted hands grabbed onto me, digging into my flesh. \\n\\n\\nThis time they didn’t settle with violence. They started whispering, begging for me to pull them out of their prisons, to take them with me. Millions of voices rushed through my head, promising it was all a misunderstanding, that they had not meant to hurt me, they wanted nothing more than the warmth of the light. \\n\\n\\nYet, with their pleas for salvation, they tore into me, ripping me apart from within. \\n\\n\\nI couldn’t help them, I didn’t know how, and with that, their voices turned from prayers to anger. They shouted obscenities from within my head, filling it with hatred, while telling me what would happen to my family once I truly perished. \\n\\n\\nIn a split second, a vision of my family’s future became burned into my memory, as if it had already happened. Depression would force my wife out of her job and into a battle with drug addiction, which eventually melted over to our son as he grew up. Unable to escape, my son would get expelled from school after school, ruined by the death of his father and his absent minded mother, at the age of sixteen, my son would get into drugs himself and ultimately die in a horrific car crash. \\n\\n\\nThat was the summery, cascade of events that followed my death, but the shadows didn’t stop there…\\n\\n\\nThey promised a way out. That they could save me, and my family if I only took them with me towards the light, but I could never reach the light. As desperately as I longed to just move on, I could never quite get there, always torn to shreds long before I touched it. \\n\\n\\nEach brief visit to the promised afterlife left me nothing more than a barren fragment of thought, alone in a world that didn’t belong to me. \\n\\n\\nNo matter what they did, nothing happened, and suddenly I was once again dragged away from the light, back to a excruciating life.\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nSince my diagnosis, I’ve died a total of sixteen times, each time I’m further ripped apart by the shadows, each time rejected by the light and flung back to my cancer riddled body. \\n\\n\\nMy family has grown tired of my presence. My once loving wife loathes my very existence, and my son is beyond traumatised. I can barely move, I can’t feed myself and I need help just getting from bed to the toilet. \\n\\n\\nBecause, by now the cancer has spread everywhere. The doctors say I couldn't possibly be alive, yet here I am. It is even starting to eat away at my brain as well, taking away not only my physical body, but the memory of what I used to be along with it.\\n\\n\\nI prayed, begged and bargained for more time with my family, and I guess something answered; As a result, I was given infinite life, just not a functioning body to go with it. \\n\\n\\nBut, infinite agony isn’t what truly haunts me, nor the fact that I’ve been rejected by the afterlife itself, because soon I won’t have a mind to worry with. \\n\\n\\nWhat truly frightens me, is that I now see the shadows while I’m awake. I hear their whispers at night as the pain medication slowly lulls me to sleep. They’re thanking me, because in their whispers of lies and deceit, their false desires of entering the light, what they really wanted was our world, and by returning to life, I’ve brought them here. \\n\\n\\nThey needed me to survive, they needed a vessel, to come here and extinguish the light we live in, to take away the small amount of happiness that still exists on earth. \\n\\n\\nThey’ve already taken mine, infecting my family with their horrific purpose and desires. \\n\\n\\n\\nI thought my wife had simply suffered one too many days due to my disease, but it’s the shadow within her that has turned her to the hateful creature she’s become. She went from a loving spouse, taking care of me in my darkest days, to spewing vile hatred in my direction for each time I returned from death. \\n\\n\\nShe hated me, and she hated my son for being a part of me. Every day she would laugh at my agony, telling me that I hadn’t done anything right, I couldn’t even die properly. In between the barrages, she’d let it slip who she had really become. She thanked me for releasing her from the dark abyss, smiling wide as she did. It wasn’t her talking, it was the creatures.\\n\\n\\nOf course, my son had been infected too, he quickly followed after my wife, when he stopped speaking and eating, only rotting away in his room, neglected by his sick mother. Once he had become as emaciated and weak as myself, he finally spoke, telling me this would only be the beginning, soon the rest would come through, another shadow for each trip I take to the beyond. \\n\\n\\nI’m stuck in my broken body, watching everything I love fade away, so I’m writing all of this down in an attempt at warning everyone, of what exists beyond the boundaries of life. I need my last deed to be something remotely useful before my mind vanishes with the rest of my decaying body.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps my only hope is to destroy my body, break down everything I am, so that no shadow can infest me, but I’m too weak, too frail to even leave my bed. \\n\\n\\nPlease don’t let the darkness spread, I’m sorry for bringing it here, and my punishment is to stay alive and watch, half-witted and broken… when all I want, is to simply leave this place.\\n\\n\\n[I want to keep falling…](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer, stage three, inoperable. Those were the words that spelled out my ultimate fate, and while it wouldn’t be a particularly original way to die, the irony wasn’t lost on me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’d never touched a cigarette during my short lifespan, despite growing up in a household where pretty much everyone inhaled those toxic fumes, including my own parents. Of course, they are both alive and healthy, even to this day they never suffered any consequences for any of their unhealthy habits, not even a dent put in their lung capacity. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Destiny truly is a fickle bitch…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There I sat at the doctor’s office, speechless after hearing the diagnosis. I’d just gone in for a persistent cough, from what I thought would be nothing more than a common cold. In all honesty, I didn’t feel that sick, but my wife had convinced me to go for a checkup regardless, and because of that checkup, I’d just been told that in less than a year, I would be dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much of a religious person. If asked, I’d put myself somewhere on the agnostic spectrum of not knowing what the hell is going on. That being said, I didn’t fear death; I had spent one too many nights thinking about my eventual departure from this world, and had accepted that life was a precious resource that would inevitably expire.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn’t think it would be so soon. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My one true quarrel with death was leaving my family behind, at the not so, ripe old age of forty-two, I still hadn’t saved up enough money to keep us afloat in case of emergency, and while my wife still worked, neither of us made enough to support a child on our own, and it just so happened we had a ten year old son together. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That’s why I started praying, begging, bargaining for a second chance. Each night I tried a different God, desperately looking for otherworldly answers regardless of religion or relevance in modern society. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was desperate. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The doctors offered a combo-treatment of radiation and chemotherapy. Of course, none would extend my life in any meaningful way, but I started the treatment nonetheless, hoping that maybe someone could offer a miracle cure. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But, of course, my hopes were left unanswered…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of this year, my body had deteriorated to the point where I was nothing but a loose sack of skin draped over a malformed set of bones. I knew I only had a few weeks left before the cancer that had gestated within me, growing with each passing day, finally won the battle. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When breathing became little more than an agonising chore, serving only to initiate a cascade of painful coughs, I ended up bedridden next to an oxygen tank.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then, finally, on July 29th, 2019, as I tried to get dressed and make the short journey from my bed to the little breakfast table down the hall in my hospital, everything suddenly disappeared beneath my feet. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I started falling…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One second I was traversing the hospital hallway, oxygen tank dragging on behind me, and with a final gasp, my pain was simply erased from existence. The memory of my disease was nothing more than a faint dream, and my life became a part of a very distant past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had died, I realised that much, but the concepts of life and death themselves meant little to me in the grand scheme of things. Yes, I had been a part of society on earth, a note in the everlasting symphony of life, but my part had passed and the song continued on without me, while I moved on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I floated, or sank, it was hard to tell directions apart in my new, weightless state. It almost seemed like an ocean. The deep blue hues surrounding me on all sides with bubbles of flickering light floating by, delightfully circling around me as I moved towards the brightest thing I’d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Though the light was blinding, I could sense other beings surrounding me. I turned to look at them, squinting my eyes to get a better grasp of what they were. They didn’t resemble any creature ever walking upon earth’s surface, but I could tell they had once been human just like myself. They were happy, smiling without having faces, voicelessly laughing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I waved at them, and they greeted me using nothing more than the warmth of their souls. I still had my body, not yet processed by the afterlife, but I felt healthy, no longer ravaged by the tumours within my chest. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got close enough to feel the heat of the light, my periphery darkened, and the joyful creatures dancing around me had been replaced by shadows staring intently at my passing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The new creatures weren’t people, but beings emitting the most dreadful sense of sadness and anger. They hated me for being able to touch the light, while they were forever trapped in the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of them reached out for me, its arms stretching impossibly far beyond its confinement. It grabbed onto my leg, pitch black nails digging deep into my flesh, tearing muscles from bone as I silently cried in agony. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I could get a grasp of my situation, another pair of hands grabbed my arm, tearing it straight from its socket. A third pair wrapped around my chest, digging deep into my lungs, rummaging around where the tumours had once lived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More hands joined in, and before long, I was enveloped by hundreds of shadows, all tearing away at my limbs and organs, but as all meat was stripped from my body, the hands had nothing more to hold onto, and I was let go. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was jolted awake, back in the hospital, gasping pathetically for air as the cancer once more inhabited most of my lung tissue. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My family stood close by, sobbing at my demise. I really had died, but only for about a minute. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Silence quickly filled the room as they noticed I was still alive, doctors wearing shocked expressions and horrified stares from my son. They were surprised, confused, as no attempt had been made to resuscitate me. My death had been expected for so long that keeping me alive would be nothing more than a cruel joke.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, once again, I lived. I had been so close to eternal salvation, but something had pulled me away, denied my entrance to whatever lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the cancer relentlessly spreading throughout my body, I wasn’t meant to stay. Despite the bittersweet taste of my revival, the locals hailed it as a miracle, and multiple news stations wanted to share my story, profit from it; I promptly declined. I didn’t want to tell anyone what I saw on the other side, and I was in too much pain to accept it as a miracle. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I stabilised, they moved me to a hospice care facility. Death was still lingering around the corner, but they said I might have a couple of more weeks to spend with my family if nothing more. They’d already said goodbye once, and now that cruel trick of nature made them do it twice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My wife didn’t smile once in the following days. She wore a tired expression on her face, her eyes were sunken, but I couldn’t blame her. Taking care of a dying man is no easy task, much less for someone that has to do it twice. My son, on the other hand, would not stop crying, he was too young to understand, but he knew I wouldn’t stay for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks came and went in the blink of an eye, each day spent in misery, dreading what awaited on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then, one morning, I simply didn’t wake up…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, the world was done with me. I had been tossed away from existence, and just like before I started falling through time and space, into an infinite void. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The shapeless beings still floated in the peripheries, lights that once wandered the earth, but this time, there were no smiles to greet me, no joy filling my soul to the brim. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were angry at me, I had returned to a place I didn’t belong, and now my journey was one no longer welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was pushed further towards the light, away from the once blissful companions, and it wasn’t long before I saw the shadows again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There the light lingered, just out of reach, so close I could almost touch it, when a pair of twisted hands grabbed onto me, digging into my flesh. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time they didn’t settle with violence. They started whispering, begging for me to pull them out of their prisons, to take them with me. Millions of voices rushed through my head, promising it was all a misunderstanding, that they had not meant to hurt me, they wanted nothing more than the warmth of the light. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, with their pleas for salvation, they tore into me, ripping me apart from within. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help them, I didn’t know how, and with that, their voices turned from prayers to anger. They shouted obscenities from within my head, filling it with hatred, while telling me what would happen to my family once I truly perished. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a split second, a vision of my family’s future became burned into my memory, as if it had already happened. Depression would force my wife out of her job and into a battle with drug addiction, which eventually melted over to our son as he grew up. Unable to escape, my son would get expelled from school after school, ruined by the death of his father and his absent minded mother, at the age of sixteen, my son would get into drugs himself and ultimately die in a horrific car crash. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was the summery, cascade of events that followed my death, but the shadows didn’t stop there…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They promised a way out. That they could save me, and my family if I only took them with me towards the light, but I could never reach the light. As desperately as I longed to just move on, I could never quite get there, always torn to shreds long before I touched it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each brief visit to the promised afterlife left me nothing more than a barren fragment of thought, alone in a world that didn’t belong to me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No matter what they did, nothing happened, and suddenly I was once again dragged away from the light, back to a excruciating life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since my diagnosis, I’ve died a total of sixteen times, each time I’m further ripped apart by the shadows, each time rejected by the light and flung back to my cancer riddled body. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My family has grown tired of my presence. My once loving wife loathes my very existence, and my son is beyond traumatised. I can barely move, I can’t feed myself and I need help just getting from bed to the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Because, by now the cancer has spread everywhere. The doctors say I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be alive, yet here I am. It is even starting to eat away at my brain as well, taking away not only my physical body, but the memory of what I used to be along with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I prayed, begged and bargained for more time with my family, and I guess something answered; As a result, I was given infinite life, just not a functioning body to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But, infinite agony isn’t what truly haunts me, nor the fact that I’ve been rejected by the afterlife itself, because soon I won’t have a mind to worry with. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What truly frightens me, is that I now see the shadows while I’m awake. I hear their whispers at night as the pain medication slowly lulls me to sleep. They’re thanking me, because in their whispers of lies and deceit, their false desires of entering the light, what they really wanted was our world, and by returning to life, I’ve brought them here. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They needed me to survive, they needed a vessel, to come here and extinguish the light we live in, to take away the small amount of happiness that still exists on earth. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’ve already taken mine, infecting my family with their horrific purpose and desires. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought my wife had simply suffered one too many days due to my disease, but it’s the shadow within her that has turned her to the hateful creature she’s become. She went from a loving spouse, taking care of me in my darkest days, to spewing vile hatred in my direction for each time I returned from death. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She hated me, and she hated my son for being a part of me. Every day she would laugh at my agony, telling me that I hadn’t done anything right, I couldn’t even die properly. In between the barrages, she’d let it slip who she had really become. She thanked me for releasing her from the dark abyss, smiling wide as she did. It wasn’t her talking, it was the creatures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, my son had been infected too, he quickly followed after my wife, when he stopped speaking and eating, only rotting away in his room, neglected by his sick mother. Once he had become as emaciated and weak as myself, he finally spoke, telling me this would only be the beginning, soon the rest would come through, another shadow for each trip I take to the beyond. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m stuck in my broken body, watching everything I love fade away, so I’m writing all of this down in an attempt at warning everyone, of what exists beyond the boundaries of life. I need my last deed to be something remotely useful before my mind vanishes with the rest of my decaying body.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my only hope is to destroy my body, break down everything I am, so that no shadow can infest me, but I’m too weak, too frail to even leave my bed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please don’t let the darkness spread, I’m sorry for bringing it here, and my punishment is to stay alive and watch, half-witted and broken… when all I want, is to simply leave this place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author\"&gt;I want to keep falling…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I\\'m not entirely sure he ever was to begin with. But one thing is for certain, I am closer now then ever to learning the secrets of Mooncreek, thanks to whatever the thing is that takes on his face and body. \\n\\nRoger, or whatever it may be; lead Jacob and I toward theater 7; casually making us popcorn as he explained the nature of the film that he wanted us to be a part of.\\n\\n\"May I just say that every time we get a chance to work on this project it just makes my heart leap! *The Mooncreek Monster* is going to set the tone for horror movies for the next thirty years. I especially appreciate getting the chance to find local talent for the parts,\" Roger said as he set up the projector. \\n\\n\"You hired people to play in the movie?\" Jacob asked. \\n\"Don\\'t be safe of course I did! This is after all, a story of the community and what the Mooncreek means to all of us!\" \\nAs he finished, he encouraged us to take a seat and said, \"I thought we would get things started by reviewing the footage thus far.\" \\n\\nI sat down as he passed me some popcorn and waited to see if this time I would see the film that was apparently the cause of all the strange things happening here. \\n\\nSurprisingly as the screen shifted to blotches of white and gray, I found myself staring at an older actor. He kind of looked like me, but maybe 10 years more down the road. And he didn\\'t look very friendly. He was walking down a hallway, carrying heavy iron chains. There was a figure standing there in what appeared to be the end of the hallway, and as the camera adjusted I realized it was none other than Antoinette. \\n\\nI did my best to hide my shock as I watched the man on camera bind the girl with the iron chains. Surprisingly despite their heaviness, it didn\\'t seem like the girl was bothered at all. She just seemed angry and violent the more the old actor worked to wrap them around her body. \\n\\nThen the camera flipped to the next scene, showing the actor moving the girl toward that same sealed door we had discovered the night before. \\n\\nJacob was there in the film as well, eagerly pushing Antoinette into the darkened tunnel and then closing the seal. It was at that point the film stopped and Roger excitedly turned to us, his eyes hopeful for our opinion. \\n\\n\"What do you think? Does it highlight the real plight of the main character?\" Roger asked. \\n\\nI was too shocked by the imagery to respond, but Jacob was eager to ask questions. \\n\\n\"Roger... is Antoinette the star of this film?\" \\n\\n\"Well of course she is! Don\\'t tell me you forgot! We made this whole theater just for her!\" he snapped and then turned toward me and remarked, \"Mister Saunders with your permission I want to go ahead and move forward with the final scene of the movie tonight.\" \\n\\nI didn\\'t know what else to do but to say yes to his request. Then Roger dashed out of the theater, eager to set up equipment as Jacob and I watched him leave. \\n\\n\"I told you the girl was bad news,\" my partner said sourly. \\n\\n\"Maybe... or maybe you\\'re the one who has been manipulating me this entire time,\" I said looking him in the eye as I stood up. \\n\\n\"What\\'s that supposed to mean? I\\'ve been nothing but helpful this entire time!\" Jacob snarled. \\n\\n\"Except for the fact that you\\'ve been the one to push this. Insisting that we can\\'t let it go. And now, when things are finally starting to come together; you\\'re hesitant. Tell me what you\\'re hiding Jacob Cobb... if that\\'s even your real name.\" \\n\\nHe waved his hand dismissively at me. \\n\"You\\'re grasping at straws old man. You want this little fantasy to make sense, but I think you\\'re being drawn into it just as much as I am! Randolph should have torn this place down! But now that it\\'s got people in it again, the Mooncreek is going to finish the story. And it\\'s using us to play the parts it wants,\" he insisted. \\n\\n\"This building is part of us, whether we like it or not. So maybe it is up to us to see how this plays out. Maybe it will make things right,\" I said. \\n\\n\"We don\\'t even know what we are waiting for!\" Jacob snapped back. \\n\\nRoger was dashing back up the steps, smiling ear to ear. \\n\\n\"I just got off the phone with them. They said they will be eager to come here. Probably around 3:30 this afternoon for a special showing. We need to get everything ready,\" he said. \\n\\nJacob and I both looked at him, our faces a picture of mixture and confusion. \\n\\n\"Wait... who did you call?\" I asked. \\n\\n\"Antoinette\\'s parents of course. They need to be here in theater 7 for the final scene. That\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be,\" Roger said firmly. \\n\\nI glanced at Jacob and nodded slowly. \"Right.... of course. Could you remind me exactly what the plan is tonight? I just want to be sure I do my best,\" i said. \\n\\nRoger Darcey laughed and it echoed the dark theater. \\n\\n\"That\\'s an easy one, Mister Saunders. We\\'re bringing them here to kill them,\" he said as he shot me the most serious look and then muttered that he needed to go clean the bathrooms.\\xa0 \\n\\nOnce he was gone, Jacob squeezed my shoulder. \"Enough is enough, we need to call Randolph. Get him to tear this place down. It\\'s cursed. And we can\\'t just let it happen this way! We can\\'t be part of this,\" he insisted. \\n\\nI shook my head, confused by all that was happening. \"I... I don\\'t know what to do anymore. Jacob, why is this happening?\" I asked. \\n\\n\"Hell if I know, listen to me; old man. We can\\'t stay here. We need to get out. We need to get out now,\" Jacob insisted. \\n\\nI pulled away from him, trying to see the reason in his words. But I couldn\\'t. I couldn\\'t walk away from the Mooncreek. \\n\\n\"You can leave if you want, son. I understand that. This place doesn\\'t hold anything for you. But this is my life. I\\'ve got nothing left,\" I said. \\n\\nJacob Cobb clenched his lip and shook his head in disgust. \\n\\n\"You\\'re being played. The Mooncreek is going to be the death of you,\" he said and then waved his hand dismissively in my face. \"You want this fantasy to be real so badly, that the Mooncreek will give you exactly what you want.\" \\n\\n\"But it\\'s your funeral, not mine. I\\'m out of here.\" \\n\\nI watched him walk down the steps of the theater and disappear as I slumped in the chair and thought about the events that had led me here. \\n\\nI came here to fulfill a dream, but now I wasn\\'t sure what that dream even was. I guess that\\'s how dreams are though. You never know the beginning or the end. We\\'re always in the middle. Dreams make us who we are, but we can never define them. Isn\\'t that a paradox?\\n\\nSomehow or another while musing over this, I found my way back to the loft and began to sift through things. I was searching for anything here amid the collection to spark a new clue into this. \\n\\nThen I looked at Saunders diary. I had hardly been able to read most of it before. But maybe I hadn\\'t tried hard enough. \\n\\nI opened it up and then rummaged about for something amid the papers that I could use to copy down the parts of the writing I understood. \\n\\nIt amazed me that as I managed to study the brush strokes of Mister Saunders, I also found myself mimicking them. \\nEventually I was able to gather a picture of the events that led to the theater being shut down. \\n\\n*January 19 1988, the winter here is slow. But the work can\\'t be impeded if we are to finish on time. Talerin suspects nothing. He believes that I have asked his daughter here under the pretense of having her as part of a film that is being managed by Mister Darcey. I understand now the charge that is to be made before me. This is the only way that things can be set right. Tonight, I will be luring the girl...* \\n\\nI felt a chill in the air as I read the ominous words. Then I looked up and saw that one of my windows had cracked open a tad. I moved to close it, and then stood still; seeing in the faint reflection a ghastly visage standing behind me. It was whispering strange words, that made sense in the cloudy parts of my brain. \\n\\n*Howard Saunders is a man that we made. It is the man you must become. We make your story. We make your purpose.* the thing rasped in my mind. I considered turning to face it but it was upon me in a flash, and as it got closer I recognized it as the same older actor that I had seen in the film that same night. \\n\\n*Accept your story. Accept your dream. And let us in* it whispered. It was soothing and calm and reasonable. I couldn\\'t even imagine saying no. When I did, the spirit seemed to slowly faded into the ether; but as it did... I felt a heaviness on my chest. \\n\\nI stumbled backward and found a seat amid the mess. \\n\\nThe pain only continued to increase. I placed my hand near to my heart and closed my eyes, breathing rapidly and praying to calm down. Then I looked up and I looked at the mirror. \\n\\nWhat I saw seemed like a miracle. I looked like a younger man. Almost attractive. \\n\\nI stood up and touched my skin, surprised to find my wrinkles gone. Then I looked at my hands and saw the same. I was made new again. \\n\\nI stood up to take a closer look, wishing I understood what magic had made this possible and I found myself chuckling. It was the sort of laugh I hadn\\'t found the courage to spit out for days. \\n\\nBut that laugh eventually turned to worry as I recalled Jacob\\'s warning. *you want this fantasy to be real so badly, the Mooncreek will give you what you want* he had said. \\n\\nI touched my skin again, wondering if that was what was happening here. No... this wasn\\'t in my imagination. The things I experienced here were quite real. And I would be damned if I was going to simply step away now, when I was close to the answers. \\n\\nI smiled at my younger reflection. \\n\\nMaybe it was a fantasy? Maybe a little bit? \\n\\nIs that really so bad?\\n\\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)',\n",

I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure he ever was to begin with. But one thing is for certain, I am closer now then ever to learning the secrets of Mooncreek, thanks to whatever the thing is that takes on his face and body. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roger, or whatever it may be; lead Jacob and I toward theater 7; casually making us popcorn as he explained the nature of the film that he wanted us to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;May I just say that every time we get a chance to work on this project it just makes my heart leap! &lt;em&gt;The Mooncreek Monster&lt;/em&gt; is going to set the tone for horror movies for the next thirty years. I especially appreciate getting the chance to find local talent for the parts,&amp;quot; Roger said as he set up the projector. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You hired people to play in the movie?&amp;quot; Jacob asked. \\n&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be safe of course I did! This is after all, a story of the community and what the Mooncreek means to all of us!&amp;quot; \\nAs he finished, he encouraged us to take a seat and said, &amp;quot;I thought we would get things started by reviewing the footage thus far.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sat down as he passed me some popcorn and waited to see if this time I would see the film that was apparently the cause of all the strange things happening here. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly as the screen shifted to blotches of white and gray, I found myself staring at an older actor. He kind of looked like me, but maybe 10 years more down the road. And he didn&amp;#39;t look very friendly. He was walking down a hallway, carrying heavy iron chains. There was a figure standing there in what appeared to be the end of the hallway, and as the camera adjusted I realized it was none other than Antoinette. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did my best to hide my shock as I watched the man on camera bind the girl with the iron chains. Surprisingly despite their heaviness, it didn&amp;#39;t seem like the girl was bothered at all. She just seemed angry and violent the more the old actor worked to wrap them around her body. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then the camera flipped to the next scene, showing the actor moving the girl toward that same sealed door we had discovered the night before. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob was there in the film as well, eagerly pushing Antoinette into the darkened tunnel and then closing the seal. It was at that point the film stopped and Roger excitedly turned to us, his eyes hopeful for our opinion. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you think? Does it highlight the real plight of the main character?&amp;quot; Roger asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was too shocked by the imagery to respond, but Jacob was eager to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roger... is Antoinette the star of this film?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well of course she is! Don&amp;#39;t tell me you forgot! We made this whole theater just for her!&amp;quot; he snapped and then turned toward me and remarked, &amp;quot;Mister Saunders with your permission I want to go ahead and move forward with the final scene of the movie tonight.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do but to say yes to his request. Then Roger dashed out of the theater, eager to set up equipment as Jacob and I watched him leave. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you the girl was bad news,&amp;quot; my partner said sourly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe... or maybe you&amp;#39;re the one who has been manipulating me this entire time,&amp;quot; I said looking him in the eye as I stood up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean? I&amp;#39;ve been nothing but helpful this entire time!&amp;quot; Jacob snarled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Except for the fact that you&amp;#39;ve been the one to push this. Insisting that we can&amp;#39;t let it go. And now, when things are finally starting to come together; you&amp;#39;re hesitant. Tell me what you&amp;#39;re hiding Jacob Cobb... if that&amp;#39;s even your real name.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He waved his hand dismissively at me. \\n&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re grasping at straws old man. You want this little fantasy to make sense, but I think you&amp;#39;re being drawn into it just as much as I am! Randolph should have torn this place down! But now that it&amp;#39;s got people in it again, the Mooncreek is going to finish the story. And it&amp;#39;s using us to play the parts it wants,&amp;quot; he insisted. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This building is part of us, whether we like it or not. So maybe it is up to us to see how this plays out. Maybe it will make things right,&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t even know what we are waiting for!&amp;quot; Jacob snapped back. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roger was dashing back up the steps, smiling ear to ear. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just got off the phone with them. They said they will be eager to come here. Probably around 3:30 this afternoon for a special showing. We need to get everything ready,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob and I both looked at him, our faces a picture of mixture and confusion. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait... who did you call?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Antoinette&amp;#39;s parents of course. They need to be here in theater 7 for the final scene. That&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be,&amp;quot; Roger said firmly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at Jacob and nodded slowly. &amp;quot;Right.... of course. Could you remind me exactly what the plan is tonight? I just want to be sure I do my best,&amp;quot; i said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Darcey laughed and it echoed the dark theater. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s an easy one, Mister Saunders. We&amp;#39;re bringing them here to kill them,&amp;quot; he said as he shot me the most serious look and then muttered that he needed to go clean the bathrooms.\\xa0 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once he was gone, Jacob squeezed my shoulder. &amp;quot;Enough is enough, we need to call Randolph. Get him to tear this place down. It&amp;#39;s cursed. And we can&amp;#39;t just let it happen this way! We can&amp;#39;t be part of this,&amp;quot; he insisted. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, confused by all that was happening. &amp;quot;I... I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Jacob, why is this happening?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hell if I know, listen to me; old man. We can&amp;#39;t stay here. We need to get out. We need to get out now,&amp;quot; Jacob insisted. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled away from him, trying to see the reason in his words. But I couldn&amp;#39;t. I couldn&amp;#39;t walk away from the Mooncreek. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can leave if you want, son. I understand that. This place doesn&amp;#39;t hold anything for you. But this is my life. I&amp;#39;ve got nothing left,&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob Cobb clenched his lip and shook his head in disgust. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re being played. The Mooncreek is going to be the death of you,&amp;quot; he said and then waved his hand dismissively in my face. &amp;quot;You want this fantasy to be real so badly, that the Mooncreek will give you exactly what you want.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s your funeral, not mine.

The monitors only illuminated the area up until a certain point. However, we couldn’t see any walls, which meant the place had to be bigger than what could be seen, either by a little or a lot. We couldn\\'t know unless we decided to venture further into the darkness. Neither of us took that initiative, though, keeping it a mystery. \\n\\nStill… it didn’t *feel* like anybody was in there with us, so we allowed ourselves to relax a bit. I took the first sitting shift, lying back in the chair and focusing on the monitor that I deemed most interesting at the moment. \\n\\n**WireHead Vs. Luze** \\n\\nWho was I rooting for? None of them. Nevertheless, I was morbidly eager to see these two horrific titans square off. Among us guards, we’d created an unofficial “tier” system, ranking each respective Void in terms of the estimated threat that they posed. (In comparison to each other). \\n\\nThe tiers went as such:\\n\\n**Tornado** -  (weakest) \\n\\n**Tsunami** \\n\\n**Hurricane** - (mid)\\n\\n**Earthquake** \\n\\n**Asteroid** - (highest, imminent death, get the fuck out) \\n\\nThey were also divided into ‘sub-divisions’ (high, low, mid, etc.)\\n\\nWith that said, Luze was around a High-Tornado while WireHead was a Mid-Tsunami. A glaring difference between them, but not enough that would make it impossible for Luze to win. \\n\\n“Wanna make a bet?” I asked Sandhu, half-jokingly. \\n\\nHe chuckled. “You know my luck\\'s cursed. But I guess if we don’t make it outta here alive, then my debt\\'s null anyway.” \\n\\nLuze was more of a defensive combatant, so it wasn’t surprising when WireHead initiated the conflict. He twirled his bat around (still with remnants of guard flesh clinging onto it), in a near-mocking fashion at Luze. He was a delinquent, after all. \\n\\nLuze hardly reacted, of course. That’s just the way he was. In response, he stepped forward, electricity flickering through his hands and up to his forearms. WireHead followed suit, unleashing a *big* swing at Luze’s head, which he managed to intercept with one of his forearms. \\n\\nNevertheless, the wires still pierced his skin. WireHead followed it up with a head-butt. This time, it connected with the flesh-side of Luze’s face, slicing him up rather gruesomely. \\n\\nBut despite his seemingly grievous injures, he remained unwavering. That was the thing about Luze. He was incapable of feeling any pain. Like I said, his exact origins remained a mystery, but the one thing we knew about him for sure was the fact that he hailed from some kind of ancient clan residing in the Arctic Circle. In fact, he was the sole survivor of an “incident” that decimated his village, and he was hungry for revenge against the unknown force that did it. \\n\\nAfter taking the head-butt, Luze was now in striking range. He formed his fingers into an arrow-shape and drove them into WireHead’s solar-plexus, before electrocuting his insides. \\n\\nWireHead quaked in pain as he swung his bat in a frenzied rage, just about demolishing Luze’s ribcage. No reaction from him, though. Instead, he took his other hand and wrapped it around WireHead’s neck. Any normal person would’ve succumbed to Luze’s electrical shocks after a few seconds. But of course, WireHead was no normal person. Despite blood pouring out from chest wound and the skin on his neck beginning to bubble, he picked Luze up by the torso and slammed him over the steel railing. \\n\\nHe fucking *broke* his back. Even without sound, the mental audio of a spine snapping reverberated throughout my mind. \\n\\nUnsurprisingly, Luze didn’t bat an eye. WireHead went in for the kill, tossing Luze’s body onto the ground before smashing until it resembled nothing more than a mess of bloody pulp and broken bones. \\n\\nBut somehow... he was still *alive*. Among the gruesome pile, I could see an eye blink. \\n\\nOnce WireHead had exhausted himself from his relentless swinging, Luze took his chance. Using his one arm that hadn’t been smashed to bits, he crawled over and grabbed WireHead by the foot, before scaling himself up to his neck. \\n\\nOnce there, he drilled his fist into WireHead’s forehead, utterly shredding his own hand in the process.\\n\\nIn the end, it was worth the sacrifice. He was able to electrocute WireHead’s brain, finally causing the behemoth to drop. \\n\\n“So… I guess he won?” Sandhu said. \\n\\n“I... guess?\" \\n\\nI had my own reservations about calling Luze’s performance a “victory”. By the end of it, all of his limbs and his spine had been shattered, and not an inch of his body wasn’t hosting a series of deep cuts. The good side of his face had also been chipped away to the skull, leaving only his eye and half his nose intact. \\n\\nAnd yet… he didn’t move with a hint of desperation or concern, calmly crawling away from the scene using his one mangled hand. I could still see the current flowing through it as well, a tell-tale sign that he was ready to pick up another fight. \\n\\n“Nice. Comeback victory.” Sandhu said. “I don\\'t see him making it far, though. Not as a Tornado-Tier\" \\n\\n“Yeah, but we made all of that shit up. Not like it means anything.” I responded. \\n\\nTruth be told, I was nearly *rooting* for Luze at the end there. Something about his resilience resonated with me, as bizarre as it may seem. \\n\\nI scanned the rest of the monitors. While WireHead and Luze were squaring off, the Undead Nazi had burnt Dyaxek to a crisp. \\n\\nOn another monitor, Morgi playing around with a Void corpse that I recognized as *Death Shadow*. (He chose his own name). \\n\\n\"3 down...\" I muttered to myself. \\n\\n“Fuck, we got a big one coming up.” Sandhu announced. \\n\\nI followed his eyes to a monitor near the bottom of the room. He was right. This one was gonna be good. Standing at opposite sides of the kitchen were:\\n\\n*Trench* - 6’3 (190 cm), 330 lbs (150 kg) \\n\\nAnd:\\n\\n*Senju* - 5’10 (177 cm), 148 lbs (67 kg) \\n\\nTrench was a silent entity dressed entirely in ancient-looking deep-sea diving gear, except for the head, which remained without a helmet. However, you couldn’t get a glimpse of its face regardless. That was due to the fact that his features were completely distorted, so much so that if you tried focusing on the details, all you were getting was a nasty migraine. \\n\\nOn top of that, he was invisible in person. \\n\\nLet me explain: \\n\\nIf he were standing right in front of you, you wouldn’t be able to see him. The only way to get a glimpse of him was through “secondary” means, (Cameras, mirrors, etc.), which made him all the more dangerous. \\n\\nAs for how he killed people -  it was either by brute force using his monstrous strength or b his “Death Aura”, as us guards have dubbed it. Similar to Dyaxek’s “zone”, once you were in his close vicinity, you’d feel an astronomical amount of pressure and get crushed on the spot, comparable to what you’d feel standing at the bottom of the ocean. But that’s only if Trench wills it. Sometimes, he\\'ll turn the aura off and simply punch somebody’s head off. \\n\\nFor that reason, he was in the Mid-Hurricane tier. \\n\\nAs for Senju… well he was basically a psychotic, demon-possessed martial artist with supernatural levels of speed, strength and agility. He apparently trained in the “Wraith Style”, or the “technique beyond human comprehension”, whatever the hell those were supposed to mean. \\n\\nWhen he gets serious, his eyes will roll into the back of his head and black veins will begin bulging out from underneath his skin. At that point, he’ll be moving so fast that his motions become impossible to keep up with visually, and a single punch from him will be enough to completely vaporize a human head. \\n\\nBut in all honesty, he’s one of the least malicious Voids out of the bunch. If you’re weak (like us guards), he won’t even spare you a glance, granted that you stay out of his way. The only thing that he’s really looking for are “strong opponents” to fight. \\n\\nBut… when he can’t find one… he starts to get antsy. And then problems emerge. \\n\\nWe’ve pegged him at a Low-Hurricane. \\n\\n“Can Senju even see Trench?” Sandhu asked? \\n\\n“I… guess so?” I responded. \\n\\nThe question was worth asking, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if Trench’s Aura/invisibility simply didn’t work on him at all. \\n\\nThat seemed to be the case, since Senju decided to strike first. He rushed forward at an unfathomable speed, directing what must have been hundreds of strikes in succession at Trench. \\n\\nHowever, none of them fazed the obscure diver. I could see Senju’s lips curling into a psychotic grin at the fact. He certainly found what he was looking for. \\n\\nThe floor beneath him cracked as his eyes turned white and his grotesque veins began bulging. If we couldn’t see his strikes before, it was beyond impossible now. He rushed forward, unleashing a maelstrom of lightning-like punches, elbows and kicks against Trench. \\n\\nThis went on for about 5 seconds before he was stopped in his tracks. Trench had grabbed him by the throat, still not looking any worse for wear in the process. I could see Senju mouth something to the effect of “what the fuck” before he was tossed into a metal fridge. \\n\\nIt certainly appeared as if Trench was too much of a tank for him to handle. \\n\\nNevertheless, Senju got back up and cracked his shoulder into place while blood leaked from his mouth. And then he seemed to let out a shriek. \\n\\n*Crazy fucker*, I thought to myself. What the hell did it take for somebody to become like this? \\n\\nAt that point, he’d seemingly given up on technique entirely. Instead, he grabbed a handful of kitchen knives and began chucking them at Trench. While none of them pierced the suit, one of them managed to stick in his distorted head, which evidently dealt some damage. \\n\\nTrench flinched, before taking the knife out and throwing it back at Senju, who in turn caught it effortlessly. At this point, he was howling in what I assumed was some kind of fucked-up sadomasochistic jubilation. He’d found the weak point.  \\n\\nSenju rushed back at Trench, knife in hand, before slashing away at its face. Spurts of vicious, dark-blue blood stained the kitchen floor, along with Senju’s own face. Soon enough, the knife snapped, and Trench threw a desperation punch at Senju’s temple. He managed to block it with his forearm, although I could see his bones cracking from the impact. \\n\\nHe leapt back as his arm hung limp to his side, dodging a follow-up haymaker. Throughout everything, a grin remained plastered on his face. His veins were bulging out so hard that I found it hard to believe they weren’t going to completely burst altogether. \\n\\nWith one arm, Senju lifted a metal table and swung it into the side of Trench’s head, nearly taking it off in the process. He wasted no time, grabbing a large frying pan and pouncing at his incapacitated opponent, knocking them both over in the process. \\n\\nHe then took a position atop Trench’s body, furiously slamming the pan onto his face. \\n\\n“Martial arts, eh…” I could hear Sandhu mutter. \\n\\nAfter what must’ve been 250 blows, the pan broke. On the ground. Trench’s head had been obliterated no less than 50 strikes prior. Senju tossed the scrap metal aside and looked up at the ceiling, presumably screaming his lungs sore in sheer, combative delight. \\n\\n“Well… looks like our Tier System means fuck all.” I chuckled. \\n\\nDespite the morbid scene unfolding in front of us, Sandhu shared a laugh with me. We were at the point where the absolute absurdity and danger of the situation was beginning to fade from our senses. Hell… I suppose we were *enjoying* ourselves, as fucked up as that may sound. \\n\\nWe kept watching as Senju got up and stumbled around, evidently disoriented from both his injuries and successive fits of fighting-spirit induced rage-euphoria. He took about 4 steps before his head exploded, throwing the two of us watching for quite the loop. \\n\\nAnother figure stepped into the frame, whom we recognized as *Satan-Bot* - 6’11 (211 cm), 535 lbs (243 kg). \\n\\nI felt a shiver crawl down my spine upon seeing him, somewhat snapping me back into reality. Despite his comical name, Satan-Bot had to be one of the most frightening Voids out there. \\n\\nI just… couldn’t understand what the fuck he was supposed to be. His body appeared to be robotic, but moved in ways that were *too* fluid for even the most sophisticated android. Like legitimate metallic flesh. It was honestly maddening to look at. \\n\\nOn top of that, he literally resembled the fucking devil himself. Reddish-black scaly skin/metallic shell, a mouth full of exposed, razor-like teeth, rectangular, slanted crimson eyes, a pair of large, mechanical wings and a long tail ending in something that resembled a 3-pronged spear to boot. For whatever reason, he also had a rocket-launcher atop his right shoulder and a Gatling gun connected to his left hand. No, these were not mechanical modifications. They were literally connected to his body. \\n\\nHe was unanimously considered one of the most dangerous Voids residing in the Chasm, rated at a High-Earthquake. Even if Senju was at his full-strength, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. \\n\\n“Oh shit,” Sandhu commented. “I was hoping he didn\\'t escape.” \\n\\n“Well… let’s not worry about him for now.” I said, turning my attention to another monitor. \\n\\nWhat my eyes landed on next was an utter massacre. Sitting atop a pile of guard bodies that must’ve eclipsed 6 feet was Hugo Wright, AKA *The Brutal Bishop* - 6’2 (189 cm), 200 lbs (91 kg). \\n\\nLike his name indicated, he was dressed in a traditional Vicar Priest outfit. The only difference was the fact that the cross he wore around his neck was fashioned out of blades. The man himself had long, sweeping black hair and about fourteen bags under both of his dead, blue eyes. \\n\\nIt was unclear to us what his real motivations were. It’s not like he really followed the rules of any religion on Earth, despite his outfit. He just went on long rants about “the sin of natalism” and the “futility of existence”, and how “to reach a state of sanctity, we must first reach a clean state.” Basically, he wanted to kill every sentient being on Earth, and then himself. He wasn’t all talk, either. He was certainly strong. \\n\\nWe rated him at a Low-Hurricane. \\n\\nAfter praying to whatever fucked-up deity he worshiped atop his pile of corpses, he slid down and began stalking the corridors for some more victims to fulfill his ‘holy’ objective. \\n\\nWho he came across next couldn’t have been more perfect. \\n\\nKael Silva, AKA *Vampire Cop* - 5’9 (175 cm), 176 lbs (80kg). \\n\\nKael was rather interesting, being that he was one of the most co-operative Voids. In fact, he was the only prisoner that *willingly* turned himself in. \\n\\nHis backstory was interesting as well, and of the few we actually *knew* about. He used to be a prolific, merciless Brazilian cop who patrolled the most dangerous parts of Rio. It was so much so that he earned a reputation amongst the criminal underground as “The Reaper”.  \\n\\nBut… he was still only human. During one fateful mission, his entire unit was massacred during an ambush attack by about a dozen distinct gangs who were all unified under the same goal of taking him down. He was the only survivor, but was captured in the process. \\n\\nAfter being brutally tortured in a warehouse for about 5 hours, the lights suddenly went out. \\n\\nDuring this period of darkness, the only sounds entering his ears were those of carnage. Every single gang member was being *obliterated* by some unknown force. At the end of the bloodbath, he could hear footsteps slowly approaching him, before a deep, raspy voice whispered something into his ear:\\n\\n*”There’s potential in you. Allow me to bestow you with an opportunity.”* \\n\\nHe felt a sharp pain hit his neck before the hidden entity spoke to him again. \\n\\n*”Fulfill your duty.”*\\n\\nAnd then he passed out. \\n\\nWhen he woke up, he found himself in his bed, with all the wounds from his torture session just about healed. All wounds expect for one – a bite-mark on his neck. His appearance had also changed drastically. \\n\\nPale skin, dark eyes and fangs. He’d heard about the stories, but could hardly comprehend that he’d become one himself. While he couldn’t handle being exposed to the sun anymore, he found himself with superhuman strength and regeneration, which he used to brutalize criminals at night as a vigilante. \\n\\nHowever, it didn’t take long for him to go too far. One night, he went into a frenzy, breaking into the house of a suspected rapist and killing everybody inside. Everybody including the rapist’s innocent mother and daughter. \\n\\nHis resolve in regards to justice had never wavered, remaining strong no matter what he went through. For that reason, he could hardly live with guilt on his conscience, and walked to the police station he used to work at, turning himself in to his former colleagues that all thought he was dead. Of course, the news spread quickly. That’s when the CIA stepped in and transferred him over to the Chasm. \\n\\nHe put up no resistance. In fact, he deemed the Chasm a place where he 100% belonged. \\n\\nSafe to say, he was a rather bizarre case. We still put him at a Low-Hurricane, same as Hugo. \\n\\nOn the monitor, I could see Kael’s lips moving. Wanting to hear what he had to say, I began looking around to see if I could get some audio. It didn’t take too long for me to find the volume control panel, which was located right under the middle desk. Thankfully, whoever set this weird place up took the liberty of labeling each switch with its respective monitor. \\n\\nI turned the volume up right in the middle of Kael’s spiel. \\n\\n“…dangerous scum. I’m gonna have to dispose of you all before it’s too late.” \\n\\nHugo’s face remained expressionless. \\n\\n“Scum… an apt description of the ones residing in this place. But I understand that you’re also a man wrought with unforgivable sin. I’ll treat you no differently.” He responded. \\n\\nKael chuckled. “Wouldn’t expect you not to,” He took a provocative fighting stance. “C\\'mon, Englishman. Let\\'s settle this.” \\n\\nHugo put a hand on his blade-cross, before muttering another prayer to himself. He looked up at Kael, his eyes now a deep crimson. \\n\\n“The atrocities I commit are only in the pursuit of ultimate holiness. I hope you can understand that.” \\n\\nKael grinned. “Yeah. I get it. Crazy people are crazy.” \\n\\nAs he finished the sentence, he rushed forward in a quick blur, sinking his fangs into Hugo’s neck. \\n\\nIn turn, Hugo grabbed Kael’s head and twisted, snapping his neck in what had to be the most gruesome manner feasible, before plunging a fist into his chest. \\n\\nFor the first time, Hugo grimaced. \\n\\n“What’s wrong with your heart?” He asked, before retracting his hand, revealing severe burn marks. \\n\\nKael twisted his head back into place before shooting Hugo a bloody grin. “I couldn’t tell you, buddy.” \\n\\nThey traded blows for a few more minutes, pummeling each other into oblivion. While Kael was certainly more skilled and had more “tools” at his disposal, Hugo possessed more raw power. \\n\\nEventually, it came to a standstill. Kael had suffered upwards of 20 fatal injuries, forcing his regeneration abilities to the brink. Hugo was bleeding all over, had about 6 bone fractures, an eye gouged out and an ear ripped off. \\n\\n“You’re… pretty fucking annoying, aren’t you?” Kael rasped out. \\n\\nHugo bent over, coughing up a mouthful of blood. “Likewise.” \\n\\nIn the meantime, their confrontation had drawn an audience. Coming in from an intersecting corridor was *Infernal Gladiator* - 6’7 (200 cm), 285 lbs (129 kg). He was a High-Hurricane. \\n\\nImagine an extremely buff zombie that was perpetually burning, clad in ancient gladiator gear. That was him. In one of his hands, he gripped a *gigantic*, flaming sword. In his other, he held two leashes, both holding respective Voids at the neck, crawling at his feet like dogs straight from hell. \\n\\nOne was *The Freak* - 6’10 (208 cm), 253 lbs (115 kg), a slouching, humanoid monster with strange, flickering eyes and a grin that wrapped around its entire head. The other was *The Human-ish Centipede* - 6’4 (193 cm, standing height), 372 lbs (169 kg), a centipede-like creature that had a vaguely human face covered in 6 eyes, with an iron muzzle obscuring the mouth area. It crawled on 10 colossal, veiny arms. \\n\\nThey were both Mid-Tornado Tier. Not incredibly powerful. They were merely simple, aggressive beasts that possessed nothing but primal bloodlust and strength that was comparable to 3 wild bears put together. \\n\\nFor that reason, they were easily converted into disposable weapons by the much stronger and more intelligent gladiator. \\n\\n“Fucking hell…” Kael said upon seeing the trio. “That’s fucking disgusting.” \\n\\n“Bloody abominations,” Hugo added. “Nothing but creatures that stain this Earth.” \\n\\nThey both looked at each other and nodded, an explicit sense of mutual understanding between them.  \\n\\n“Oh boy, this is heating up.” I said, turning towards Sandhu. \\n\\nHe didn\\'t respond at first, instead looking as if he were trying to *focus* on something that wasn\\'t the screen. \\n\\n“What the hell\\'s the matter” I asked him. \\n\\n“I think… there might be somebody else in here. Don’t turn around. Just keep watching. Pretend like you didn’t hear it.” He replied, hardly above a whisper. \\n\\nIt’s not like I had to pretend. \\n\\n*Hear what?* I thought to myself. \\n\\nNevertheless, I’d never Sandhu more serious. I turned my attention back to the monitors, while forcing my ears to be alert. \\n\\nAbout 10 seconds later, I heard it. \\n\\nIt was soft for sure. I wasn’t surprised that I hadn’t noticed it up until that point. \\n\\nSomewhere in the darkness behind us, somebody was *definitely* trying to contain a giggle.',\n",

The monitors only illuminated the area up until a certain point. However, we couldn’t see any walls, which meant the place had to be bigger than what could be seen, either by a little or a lot. We couldn&amp;#39;t know unless we decided to venture further into the darkness. Neither of us took that initiative, though, keeping it a mystery. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Still… it didn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like anybody was in there with us, so we allowed ourselves to relax a bit. I took the first sitting shift, lying back in the chair and focusing on the monitor that I deemed most interesting at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WireHead Vs. Luze&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Who was I rooting for? None of them. Nevertheless, I was morbidly eager to see these two horrific titans square off. Among us guards, we’d created an unofficial “tier” system, ranking each respective Void in terms of the estimated threat that they posed. (In comparison to each other). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The tiers went as such:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tornado&lt;/strong&gt; -  (weakest) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsunami&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurricane&lt;/strong&gt; - (mid)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earthquake&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asteroid&lt;/strong&gt; - (highest, imminent death, get the fuck out) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were also divided into ‘sub-divisions’ (high, low, mid, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, Luze was around a High-Tornado while WireHead was a Mid-Tsunami. A glaring difference between them, but not enough that would make it impossible for Luze to win. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wanna make a bet?” I asked Sandhu, half-jokingly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He chuckled. “You know my luck&amp;#39;s cursed. But I guess if we don’t make it outta here alive, then my debt&amp;#39;s null anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Luze was more of a defensive combatant, so it wasn’t surprising when WireHead initiated the conflict. He twirled his bat around (still with remnants of guard flesh clinging onto it), in a near-mocking fashion at Luze. He was a delinquent, after all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Luze hardly reacted, of course. That’s just the way he was. In response, he stepped forward, electricity flickering through his hands and up to his forearms. WireHead followed suit, unleashing a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; swing at Luze’s head, which he managed to intercept with one of his forearms. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the wires still pierced his skin. WireHead followed it up with a head-butt. This time, it connected with the flesh-side of Luze’s face, slicing him up rather gruesomely. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But despite his seemingly grievous injures, he remained unwavering. That was the thing about Luze. He was incapable of feeling any pain. Like I said, his exact origins remained a mystery, but the one thing we knew about him for sure was the fact that he hailed from some kind of ancient clan residing in the Arctic Circle. In fact, he was the sole survivor of an “incident” that decimated his village, and he was hungry for revenge against the unknown force that did it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After taking the head-butt, Luze was now in striking range. He formed his fingers into an arrow-shape and drove them into WireHead’s solar-plexus, before electrocuting his insides. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;WireHead quaked in pain as he swung his bat in a frenzied rage, just about demolishing Luze’s ribcage. No reaction from him, though. Instead, he took his other hand and wrapped it around WireHead’s neck. Any normal person would’ve succumbed to Luze’s electrical shocks after a few seconds. But of course, WireHead was no normal person. Despite blood pouring out from chest wound and the skin on his neck beginning to bubble, he picked Luze up by the torso and slammed him over the steel railing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He fucking &lt;em&gt;broke&lt;/em&gt; his back. Even without sound, the mental audio of a spine snapping reverberated throughout my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Luze didn’t bat an eye. WireHead went in for the kill, tossing Luze’s body onto the ground before smashing until it resembled nothing more than a mess of bloody pulp and broken bones. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow... he was still &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. Among the gruesome pile, I could see an eye blink. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once WireHead had exhausted himself from his relentless swinging, Luze took his chance. Using his one arm that hadn’t been smashed to bits, he crawled over and grabbed WireHead by the foot, before scaling himself up to his neck. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once there, he drilled his fist into WireHead’s forehead, utterly shredding his own hand in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was worth the sacrifice. He was able to electrocute WireHead’s brain, finally causing the behemoth to drop. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So… I guess he won?” Sandhu said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I... guess?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had my own reservations about calling Luze’s performance a “victory”. By the end of it, all of his limbs and his spine had been shattered, and not an inch of his body wasn’t hosting a series of deep cuts. The good side of his face had also been chipped away to the skull, leaving only his eye and half his nose intact. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And yet… he didn’t move with a hint of desperation or concern, calmly crawling away from the scene using his one mangled hand. I could still see the current flowing through it as well, a tell-tale sign that he was ready to pick up another fight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nice. Comeback victory.” Sandhu said. “I don&amp;#39;t see him making it far, though. Not as a Tornado-Tier&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but we made all of that shit up. Not like it means anything.” I responded. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I was nearly &lt;em&gt;rooting&lt;/em&gt; for Luze at the end there. Something about his resilience resonated with me, as bizarre as it may seem. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I scanned the rest of the monitors. While WireHead and Luze were squaring off, the Undead Nazi had burnt Dyaxek to a crisp. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On another monitor, Morgi playing around with a Void corpse that I recognized as &lt;em&gt;Death Shadow&lt;/em&gt;. (He chose his own name). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;3 down...&amp;quot; I muttered to myself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck, we got a big one coming up.” Sandhu announced. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I followed his eyes to a monitor near the bottom of the room. He was right. This one was gonna be good. Standing at opposite sides of the kitchen were:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trench&lt;/em&gt; - 6’3 (190 cm), 330 lbs (150 kg) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senju&lt;/em&gt; - 5’10 (177 cm), 148 lbs (67 kg) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trench was a silent entity dressed entirely in ancient-looking deep-sea diving gear, except for the head, which remained without a helmet. However, you couldn’t get a glimpse of its face regardless. That was due to the fact that his features were completely distorted, so much so that if you tried focusing on the details, all you were getting was a nasty migraine. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, he was invisible in person. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Let me explain: &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If he were standing right in front of you, you wouldn’t be able to see him. The only way to get a glimpse of him was through “secondary” means, (Cameras, mirrors, etc.), which made him all the more dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As for how he killed people -  it was either by brute force using his monstrous strength or b his “Death Aura”, as us guards have dubbed it. Similar to Dyaxek’s “zone”, once you were in his close vicinity, you’d feel an astronomical amount of pressure and get crushed on the spot, comparable to what you’d feel standing at the bottom of the ocean. But that’s only if Trench wills it. Sometimes, he&amp;#39;ll turn the aura off and simply punch somebody’s head off. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For that reason, he was in the Mid-Hurricane tier. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As for Senju… well he was basically a psychotic, demon-possessed martial artist with supernatural levels of speed, strength and agility. He apparently trained in the “Wraith Style”, or the “technique beyond human comprehension”, whatever the hell those were supposed to mean. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When he gets serious, his eyes will roll into the back of his head and black veins will begin bulging out from underneath his skin. At that point, he’ll be moving so fast that his motions become impossible to keep up with visually, and a single punch from him will be enough to completely vaporize a human head. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But in all honesty, he’s one of the least malicious Voids out of the bunch. If you’re weak (like us guards), he won’t even spare you a glance, granted that you stay out of his way. The only thing that he’s really looking for are “strong opponents” to fight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But… when he can’t find one… he starts to get antsy. And then problems emerge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve pegged him at a Low-Hurricane. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can Senju even see Trench?” Sandhu asked? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I… guess so?” I responded. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The question was worth asking, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if Trench’s Aura/invisibility simply didn’t work on him at all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That seemed to be the case, since Senju decided to strike first. He rushed forward at an unfathomable speed, directing what must have been hundreds of strikes in succession at Trench. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, none of them fazed the obscure diver. I could see Senju’s lips curling into a psychotic grin at the fact. He certainly found what he was looking for. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The floor beneath him cracked as his eyes turned white and his grotesque veins began bulging. If we couldn’t see his strikes before, it was beyond impossible now. He rushed forward, unleashing a maelstrom of lightning-like punches, elbows and kicks against Trench. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This went on for about 5 seconds before he was stopped in his tracks. Trench had grabbed him by the throat, still not looking any worse for wear in the process. I could see Senju mouth something to the effect of “what the fuck” before he was tossed into a metal fridge. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It certainly appeared as if Trench was too much of a tank for him to handle. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Senju got back up and cracked his shoulder into place while blood leaked from his mouth. And then he seemed to let out a shriek. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy fucker&lt;/em&gt;, I thought to myself. What the hell did it take for somebody to become like this? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, he’d seemingly given up on technique entirely. Instead, he grabbed a handful of kitchen knives and began chucking them at Trench. While none of them pierced the suit, one of them managed to stick in his distorted head, which evidently dealt some damage. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trench flinched, before taking the knife out and throwing it back at Senju, who in turn caught it effortlessly. At this point, he was howling in what I assumed was some kind of fucked-up sadomasochistic jubilation. He’d found the weak point.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Senju rushed back at Trench, knife in hand, before slashing away at its face. Spurts of vicious, dark-blue blood stained the kitchen floor, along with Senju’s own face. Soon enough, the knife snapped, and Trench threw a desperation punch at Senju’s temple. He managed to block it with his forearm, although I could see his bones cracking from the impact. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He leapt back as his arm hung limp to his side, dodging a follow-up haymaker. Throughout everything, a grin remained plastered on his face. His veins were bulging out so hard that I found it hard to believe they weren’t going to completely burst altogether. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With one arm, Senju lifted a metal table and swung it into the side of Trench’s head, nearly taking it off in the process. He wasted no time, grabbing a large frying pan and pouncing at his incapacitated opponent, knocking them both over in the process. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He then took a position atop Trench’s body, furiously slamming the pan onto his face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Martial arts, eh…” I could hear Sandhu mutter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After what must’ve been 250 blows, the pan broke. On the ground. Trench’s head had been obliterated no less than 50 strikes prior. Senju tossed the scrap metal aside and looked up at the ceiling, presumably screaming his lungs sore in sheer, combative delight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well… looks like our Tier System means fuck all.” I chuckled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the morbid scene unfolding in front of us, Sandhu shared a laugh with me. We were at the point where the absolute absurdity and danger of the situation was beginning to fade from our senses. Hell… I suppose we were &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; ourselves, as fucked up as that may sound. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We kept watching as Senju got up and stumbled around, evidently disoriented from both his injuries and successive fits of fighting-spirit induced rage-euphoria. He took about 4 steps before his head exploded, throwing the two of us watching for quite the loop. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another figure stepped into the frame, whom we recognized as &lt;em&gt;Satan-Bot&lt;/em&gt; - 6’11 (211 cm), 535 lbs (243 kg). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a shiver crawl down my spine upon seeing him, somewhat snapping me back into reality. Despite his comical name, Satan-Bot had to be one of the most frightening Voids out there. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just… couldn’t understand what the fuck he was supposed to be. His body appeared to be robotic, but moved in ways that were &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; fluid for even the most sophisticated android. Like legitimate metallic flesh. It was honestly maddening to look at. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, he literally resembled the fucking devil himself. Reddish-black scaly skin/metallic shell, a mouth full of exposed, razor-like teeth, rectangular, slanted crimson eyes, a pair of large, mechanical wings and a long tail ending in something that resembled a 3-pronged spear to boot. For whatever reason, he also had a rocket-launcher atop his right shoulder and a Gatling gun connected to his left hand. No, these were not mechanical modifications. They were literally connected to his body. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was unanimously considered one of the most dangerous Voids residing in the Chasm, rated at a High-Earthquake. Even if Senju was at his full-strength, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh shit,” Sandhu commented. “I was hoping he didn&amp;#39;t escape.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well… let’s not worry about him for now.” I said, turning my attention to another monitor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What my eyes landed on next was an utter massacre. Sitting atop a pile of guard bodies that must’ve eclipsed 6 feet was Hugo Wright, AKA &lt;em&gt;The Brutal Bishop&lt;/em&gt; - 6’2 (189 cm), 200 lbs (91 kg). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like his name indicated, he was dressed in a traditional Vicar Priest outfit. The only difference was the fact that the cross he wore around his neck was fashioned out of blades. The man himself had long, sweeping black hair and about fourteen bags under both of his dead, blue eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was unclear to us what his real motivations were. It’s not like he really followed the rules of any religion on Earth, despite his outfit. He just went on long rants about “the sin of natalism” and the “futility of existence”, and how “to reach a state of sanctity, we must first reach a clean state.” Basically, he wanted to kill every sentient being on Earth, and then himself. He wasn’t all talk, either. He was certainly strong. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We rated him at a Low-Hurricane. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After praying to whatever fucked-up deity he worshiped atop his pile of corpses, he slid down and began stalking the corridors for some more victims to fulfill his ‘holy’ objective. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Who he came across next couldn’t have been more perfect. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kael Silva, AKA &lt;em&gt;Vampire Cop&lt;/em&gt; - 5’9 (175 cm), 176 lbs (80kg). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kael was rather interesting, being that he was one of the most co-operative Voids. In fact, he was the only prisoner that &lt;em&gt;willingly&lt;/em&gt; turned himself in. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His backstory was interesting as well, and of the few we actually &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; about. He used to be a prolific, merciless Brazilian cop who patrolled the most dangerous parts of Rio. It was so much so that he earned a reputation amongst the criminal underground as “The Reaper”.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But… he was still only human. During one fateful mission, his entire unit was massacred during an ambush attack by about a dozen distinct gangs who were all unified under the same goal of taking him down. He was the only survivor, but was captured in the process. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After being brutally tortured in a warehouse for about 5 hours, the lights suddenly went out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During this period of darkness, the only sounds entering his ears were those of carnage. Every single gang member was being &lt;em&gt;obliterated&lt;/em&gt; by some unknown force. At the end of the bloodbath, he could hear footsteps slowly approaching him, before a deep, raspy voice whispered something into his ear:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”There’s potential in you. Allow me to bestow you with an opportunity.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He felt a sharp pain hit his neck before the hidden entity spoke to him again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”Fulfill your duty.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then he passed out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When he woke up, he found himself in his bed, with all the wounds from his torture session just about healed. All wounds expect for one – a bite-mark on his neck. His appearance had also changed drastically. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pale skin, dark eyes and fangs. He’d heard about the stories, but could hardly comprehend that he’d become one himself. While he couldn’t handle being exposed to the sun anymore, he found himself with superhuman strength and regeneration, which he used to brutalize criminals at night as a vigilante. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, it didn’t take long for him to go too far. One night, he went into a frenzy, breaking into the house of a suspected rapist and killing everybody inside. Everybody including the rapist’s innocent mother and daughter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His resolve in regards to justice had never wavered, remaining strong no matter what he went through. For that reason, he could hardly live with guilt on his conscience, and walked to the police station he used to work at, turning himself in to his former colleagues that all thought he was dead. Of course, the news spread quickly. That’s when the CIA stepped in and transferred him over to the Chasm. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He put up no resistance. In fact, he deemed the Chasm a place where he 100% belonged. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Safe to say, he was a rather bizarre case. We still put him at a Low-Hurricane, same as Hugo. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the monitor, I could see Kael’s lips moving. Wanting to hear what he had to say, I began looking around to see if I could get some audio. It didn’t take too long for me to find the volume control panel, which was located right under the middle desk. Thankfully, whoever set this weird place up took the liberty of labeling each switch with its respective monitor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned the volume up right in the middle of Kael’s spiel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“…dangerous scum. I’m gonna have to dispose of you all before it’s too late.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hugo’s face remained expressionless. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Scum… an apt description of the ones residing in this place. But I understand that you’re also a man wrought with unforgivable sin. I’ll treat you no differently.” He responded. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kael chuckled. “Wouldn’t expect you not to,” He took a provocative fighting stance. “C&amp;#39;mon, Englishman. Let&amp;#39;s settle this.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hugo put a hand on his blade-cross, before muttering another prayer to himself. He looked up at Kael, his eyes now a deep crimson. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The atrocities I commit are only in the pursuit of ultimate holiness. I hope you can understand that.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kael grinned. “Yeah. I get it. Crazy people are crazy.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As he finished the sentence, he rushed forward in a quick blur, sinking his fangs into Hugo’s neck. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In turn, Hugo grabbed Kael’s head and twisted, snapping his neck in what had to be the most gruesome manner feasible, before plunging a fist into his chest. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Hugo grimaced. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong with your heart?” He asked, before retracting his hand, revealing severe burn marks. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kael twisted his head back into place before shooting Hugo a bloody grin. “I couldn’t tell you, buddy.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They traded blows for a few more minutes, pummeling each other into oblivion. While Kael was certainly more skilled and had more “tools” at his disposal, Hugo possessed more raw power. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it came to a standstill. Kael had suffered upwards of 20 fatal injuries, forcing his regeneration abilities to the brink. Hugo was bleeding all over, had about 6 bone fractures, an eye gouged out and an ear ripped off. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re… pretty fucking annoying, aren’t you?” Kael rasped out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hugo bent over, coughing up a mouthful of blood. “Likewise.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, their confrontation had drawn an audience. Coming in from an intersecting corridor was &lt;em&gt;Infernal Gladiator&lt;/em&gt; - 6’7 (200 cm), 285 lbs (129 kg). He was a High-Hurricane. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine an extremely buff zombie that was perpetually burning, clad in ancient gladiator gear. That was him. In one of his hands, he gripped a &lt;em&gt;gigantic&lt;/em&gt;, flaming sword. In his other, he held two leashes, both holding respective Voids at the neck, crawling at his feet like dogs straight from hell. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One was &lt;em&gt;The Freak&lt;/em&gt; - 6’10 (208 cm), 253 lbs (115 kg), a slouching, humanoid monster with strange, flickering eyes and a grin that wrapped around its entire head. The other was &lt;em&gt;The Human-ish Centipede&lt;/em&gt; - 6’4 (193 cm, standing height), 372 lbs (169 kg), a centipede-like creature that had a vaguely human face covered in 6 eyes, with an iron muzzle obscuring the mouth area. It crawled on 10 colossal, veiny arms. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were both Mid-Tornado Tier. Not incredibly powerful. They were merely simple, aggressive beasts that possessed nothing but primal bloodlust and strength that was comparable to 3 wild bears put together. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For that reason, they were easily converted into disposable weapons by the much stronger and more intelligent gladiator. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fucking hell…” Kael said upon seeing the trio. “That’s fucking disgusting.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Bloody abominations,” Hugo added. “Nothing but creatures that stain this Earth.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They both looked at each other and nodded, an explicit sense of mutual understanding between them.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh boy, this is heating up.” I said, turning towards Sandhu. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t respond at first, instead looking as if he were trying to &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; on something that wasn&amp;#39;t the screen. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What the hell&amp;#39;s the matter” I asked him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I think… there might be somebody else in here. Don’t turn around. Just keep watching. Pretend like you didn’t hear it.” He replied, hardly above a whisper. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not like I had to pretend. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hear what?&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’d never Sandhu more serious. I turned my attention back to the monitors, while forcing my ears to be alert. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 seconds later, I heard it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was soft for sure. I wasn’t surprised that I hadn’t noticed it up until that point. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the darkness behind us, somebody was &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; trying to contain a giggle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I tried to spare her… that was my mistake. She was young enough to believe the fairy tale, young enough that she didn’t need to know anything else.\\n\\nThe first time she mentioned Daddy Prince, I was curling her hair. Sarina loved curls, she called them ‘princess hairs’— and I was happy to indulge her. I was sitting on her bed, wrapping her long, dark hair into foam rollers. As I snapped the final curler into place, she sighed and hung her head.\\n\\n“What’s the matter, Sarina?” I pulled back the covers so she could slip under them, walking over to the bookshelf to choose a bedtime story. As my fingers brushed across bent spines of well-loved books, she sighed again.\\n\\n“When are we going to live with Daddy Prince?” I froze in surprise and turned to look at her. I wasn’t prepared to hear her say ‘daddy’. My throat tightened and my eyes started to burn, but I forced a smile.\\n\\n“Who is …  Daddy Prince?” hesitation came with every syllable. Sarina didn’t seem to notice; her hazel eyes were shining bright.\\n\\n“He’s my daddy of course. He wants us to live with him in his castle.” she pointed towards her wardrobe; it was castle shaped with a crenelated parapet and engraved doors. The closet was the crown jewel of her princess-themed room. I’d found it on the curb, abandoned in one of the wealthier neighborhoods.\\n\\n“Mommy, why don’t we live with Daddy?”\\n\\nI knew a day would come where my daughter would need answers. Unfortunately, I wasn’t ready to give them to her. *Not yet.* My internal prayer smoldered in my chest, but I pushed the thought away.\\n\\nInstead of facing what might have been a pivotal moment in our relationship, I changed the subject:\\n\\n“Which story should I read?”\\n\\nHer sour face told me that she knew exactly what I was up to. She flung herself back into her pillows, crossing her arms stiffly. Redness flared across her forehead as a tantrum brewed, barely restrained.\\n\\n“How about Aladdin?” I suggested. Princess Jasmine was her favorite, but this wasn’t enough to cool her temper; she shook her head.\\n\\n“... Go to bed, Mommy. I want Daddy to tell me a story instead.”  Her lips quivered, but she kept her eyes fixed on the castle closet instead of looking at me.\\n\\nThe rejection stung. I leaned over to give her forehead a kiss, which she sullenly accepted. When I made it back to my bedroom, I broke down in tears and let the mascara run into my pillow. As I calmed down and began to drift off to sleep, I heard my daughter laugh and incoherent bits of one-sided conversation.\\n\\n“Daddy... why … castle… when… mommy…”\\n\\nI woke up to Sarina’s grinning face, her hands behind her back. “Good morning, mommy!” she sounded so cheerful. Groggy, I returned the greeting and offered a sleepy smile as I threw off the covers and swooped down to hug her.\\n\\nMy hands met something cold and wet. Reflexively, I let go and looked at her closely. The little girl grinned sheepishly and showed me what she was holding. A handful of small, purple flowers; a large clump of wet dirt clinging to the roots.\\n\\n“A present from Daddy!” she declared proudly, holding them out to me. I didn’t recognize the flowers, spiky and wet, but it looked like she’d dug them out of someone’s garden.\\n\\n“Sweetie, did you go outside before I woke up?” I asked.\\n\\n“Not me, the prince.” Sarina immediately corrected. “To cheer you up. You seemed sad.”\\n\\n“I see.” I didn’t. “Well, make sure he asks the neighbors permission before going into someone else’s garden, and let me know so I don’t worry.” I didn’t believe her, but I felt so guilty from the night before that I couldn’t bring myself to call her out on her lie.\\n\\n“Okay!” she agreed immediately. I took the flowers, they were in bad shape; soggy, sad little things. I decided to let them air out by the kitchen window and told her to wash up. My little girl had mud up to her elbows! She skipped off while I busied myself making waffles. I pulled the rollers out of her hair when she returned, mud-free, before we sat down to enjoy breakfast.\\n\\n“Did you like the flowers?” she asked, looking attentively at her waffle as I poured the syrup; she wasn’t satisfied until every square was filled.\\n\\n“Of course, sweetie. Any gift from you is special to me.”  I didn’t like the flowers, but I appreciated the gesture. You aren’t supposed to be completely honest with children.\\n\\nSarina nodded with satisfaction. “He said you would! Now can we go live with him?” I nearly choked, setting down my fork and looking at her. Apparently, this conversation was going to happen, whether I was ready or not.\\n\\n“I’m sorry honey. We’re going to stay here; this is our home. We can’t move in with him.”\\n\\n“Why?” I paused. Like most parents, I was accustomed to the whys of children; that single syllable was the epitome of frustration and dread, but… I’d do my best to answer, as gently as I could.\\n\\n“Because I’m not married to him.” I tried to keep it simple. My little girl nodded but was undeterred. Her smile came back.\\n\\n“Okay. Well, then get married to him.” in her eyes, this was an easy fix. I shook my head.\\n\\n“He never asked me to marry him.” I admitted, “But that’s okay, sweetie. We have everything we need here. I have you, and you have me.”\\n\\n“He just has to ask?” the hopeful look on her face broke my heart. It wasn’t that simple. Blake didn’t want kids; he’d made that abundantly clear. I wasn’t about to reach out to him after all these years.\\n\\n“Maybe,” I said. Saying ‘no’ seemed too harsh. “But I like things the way they are right now.”\\n\\n“He told me he wants to already.” she insisted, “and he gave you a present.” my stomach twisted with a weird flutter of discomfort. Her insistence was genuine, and I found the fantasy disturbing. Do little girls typically dream up princes for their mothers?\\n\\n*Well, maybe the ones without fathers do.*\\n\\n“Sweetie, he didn’t propose.” suddenly, I was tired again. I wanted to go back to my room and hide under the covers. I couldn’t deal with any more questions, not even one. As though she sensed this, my daughter went back to her room. I could hear her playing, leaving me to scrub syrup off the table.\\n\\nWhen I went to check on her later, she was standing in the dark and lightly knocking on the castle wardrobe. *Tap tap tap,* then pausing as if she waited for an answer. Naturally, she didn’t get one. Sarina saw me looking and smiled bashfully.\\n\\n“He said he sleeps during the day.” she explained, “but I wanted to tell him the good news.” I assumed she meant ‘Daddy Prince’.\\n\\n“What good news?”\\n\\nSarina didn’t say anything, staring so intently at the closet doors that I thought she must not have heard me. I flicked on her bedroom light, which got her attention.\\n\\n“Don’t! He doesn’t like the light on.” I decided to humor her and turned it back off. I was a little concerned about the prince character she was concocting. What sort of prince preferred the dark? Then again, she’d said he was sleeping. Kid logic is irrefutable at that age, so I let it go. You learn to pick your battles as a parent.\\n\\nLeaving her to her to play, I sat at the kitchen table to pay bills and balance my checkbook. I lived paycheck to paycheck and had to pay things strategically. I could afford to pay late on some bills, but not on others. How nice it would be, if there really was a prince ready to sweep in and take care of my problems. If only.\\n\\nSarina kept to her room. When I went to get her for lunch, she was still sitting in the dark. She’d changed into one of her costume dresses; mint green satin and tulle, with a plastic crown and ribbon-wrapped scepter. Her subjects were strewn about the room, face down: barbies, mostly, but also a few stuffed animals. Normally, I wouldn’t think twice about a scene like this… but it was a little odd when the lights were off with the curtains closed.\\n\\n“It’s dark in here, honey. Are you sure you don’t want it on?” The only light came from the hallway, a yellow square of light that fell across my daughter’s small form. She beamed at me, clearly having a blast with her game.\\n\\n“I don’t want the lights.” she said, “Can I eat in my room? I’m not done playing.”\\n\\n“Alright. Come get it. Don’t forget to rinse your plate when you’re done.”  Sarina was usually a bit more energetic, ripping through the house and demanding near constant attention. I was a little unnerved, but also relieved to have a small break. Her preoccupation would enable me to finish my errands and get the house in order, no small feat with a young daughter.\\n\\nSarina skipped into the dining room, grabbed her plate, then paused suddenly. Her dark eyes fixed on the table for a moment, before she looked at me in confusion.\\n\\n“Where are the flowers? You said you liked them.”\\n\\n“They’re drying out, princess.” I smiled at her, gesturing towards the window. “They were a little wet.”\\n\\n“Oh.” she looked disappointed but didn’t say anything else. Plate in hand, she went back to her room. I heard the door close behind her. For some reason, I wanted to cry. I ate my lunch alone at the table, then went to retrieve the flowers. I brought them to the sink; the stems were tangled. Carefully, I worked them apart and rinsed away the clump of dirt holding them together.\\n\\nA metallic clink caught my attention. Something had come loose from the dirt and fallen into the sink… a ring? A muddy, tarnished ring. I picked it up, then held it under running water. It was missing a stone, and the filigree band was slightly bent… with a little love it could be beautiful again.\\n\\nIt looked very old; I didn’t know if it was valuable or not, but it was probably important to someone. I slipped the ring onto my right ring finger so I wouldn’t lose it, intending to find the owner later. I couldn’t help but think about the conversation I’d had during breakfast.\\n\\n“Looks like he proposed after all.” I laughed, amused by the coincidence. Of course, my daughter found the flowers with a ring tangled in their roots. I dropped the flowers in a bowl on the table, making a sad excuse for a centerpiece. I didn’t add water; they were wet enough already. Apparently, Sarina’s Prince Charming lived in a swamp.\\n\\nSarina stayed in her room until dinner. By then, the house was tidy, and my errands were done. When I went to get Sarina, the door was closed, and the lights were off. I knocked lightly on the door before opening it, to find my daughter standing at the castle wardrobe. The double doors were open, and she was leaning forward, peering inside.\\n\\nI turned on the light, causing her to glare at me. “Turn the lights OFF, mommy!” I didn’t, not liking the tone she was taking with me.\\n\\n“Go wash up for dinner. Now.” when she didn’t start marching, I began to count. “1….” she crossed her arms, “2…” she stomped her foot, but before I could get to three the stormed past me-- slamming the door behind her.\\n\\nThe wardrobe was still open, so I walked over to close it. The carpet was wet, soaking through my slippers, squishing with every step. As I moved to close the closet, I saw something. A pale face, crowned with golden curls and forget-me-not eyes.\\n\\n“Blake?”\\n\\nBut my ex was not crouching in his daughter’s closet. There was nothing there, except a selection of dress up clothes and plastic jewelry. The face was gone almost as soon as I’d seen it, leaving a hollow ache in my chest. I closed the doors and stood there for a long moment in silence.\\n\\nDinner was cold by the time I ladled it onto our plates. I didn’t even remember walking back to the kitchen. Sarina pushed noodles around with her fork but didn’t eat them. We didn’t talk. I felt like some part of me had checked out.\\n\\n“Mommy?” her voice pulled me back. I looked up to see her smiling at me. Relieved that the storm had passed, I smiled back.\\n\\n“What is it, sweetheart?”\\n\\n“You’re wearing the ring.” I looked down at my hands, and suddenly remembered the sorry little thing I was wearing on my right hand.\\n\\n“Oh, only for safekeeping.” I answered, “I need to find the owner. I didn’t want to lose it.”\\n\\nSarina giggled. “*You’re* the owner, silly!”\\n\\n“I’ll hold onto it, for now.” I answered, reaching over to tousle her dark curls. Her hair was damp, which gave me pause.\\n\\n“Why is your hair wet?” I asked. Sarina slouched in her chair and went back to moving food around her plate. “The carpet was wet too.” I added softly, keeping my voice quiet and non-confrontational. My little girl didn’t look up, keeping her head down.\\n\\n“Can you tell me why?” she pushed her plate away, getting up from the table and running down the hall. I heard her bedroom door slam moments later. I buried my head in my hands and took a few deep breaths, giving myself a moment before I stood and walked over to the sink to rinse off our barely touched plates. Once the kitchen was clean, I grabbed the rag towels from under the sink so I could blot Sarina’s wet carpet.\\n\\nHer door was closed, so I knocked before opening. Sarina was in bed, the blankets pulled up to her chin. The lights were off, the closet doors were ajar. My daughter was acting strange, with her eyes squeezed tightly shut. I could see her forehead furrowed from the effort as she pretended to be asleep.\\n\\n“You don’t want me to read you a bedtime story first?” I asked her softly as I dropped the towels on the floor. Brownish, reddish stains spread across the rags-- like murky rust. The smell was bad too, like mildew and rot. “...I’ll rent a carpet cleaner tomorrow. Try not to track in any more mud, it’s hard to clean.” I did my best not to sound angry, but there was a quiver in my voice. I wanted to cry.\\n\\nI blotted up the mess as best I could, spraying down the area with carpet cleaner and ruining towels in the process. Muddy carpets shouldn’t have been a breaking point for me, but with my daughter feigning sleep only feet away... I was weak. Why was everything so hard? Every obstacle broke me. I was a bad mother; weak, broken and alone. As much as I pretended everything was alright, nothing was.\\n\\n“Mommy.” Sarina spoke softly, startling me back to attention. “I want you to be happy. You’re sad all the time.” I looked up; she was sitting up in bed now. She looked past me, at the closet. The doors were still open, but I didn’t see any phantom exes peering back at us.\\n\\n“I know sweetie. I’m sorry, I’m doing my best.”\\n\\n“You’re wearing it on the wrong hand.” she answered, flopping back into her pillows and pulling the blankets up to her nose. I didn’t know what she meant, but she closed her eyes again. I stood up, kissing her on the forehead.\\n\\n“Goodnight.” my throat felt tight but having a breakdown in her room wasn’t the answer. I needed to get some rest. I was tired, that’s all. I moved to close the wardrobe, surprised to meet resistance. The doors didn’t close.\\n\\n“Leave it open. Daddy Prince likes to watch over me.”\\n\\nI was too tired to argue and left to take a long shower. The stink of the mud was sticking to me, even when I used my most fragrant soaps. After I was done, wrapped up in the only clean towel, I passed my daughter’s room on the way to mine. As I peered inside, something stopped me in my tracks.\\n\\nA white gloved hand, beckoning from the closet… and Sarina’s small hand reaching out to take it, before she was violently pulled into the wardrobe with a loud *snap.*\\n\\n“Sarina!”\\n\\nI ran into the bedroom just as the doors slammed shut. I pulled on the handles, alarmed by the deafening silence. My daughter didn’t answer my cries; she didn’t make a sound. When I managed to pry the doors open, the closet was empty. Even her dress-up clothes were gone.\\n\\nI screamed, but no one answered. I knocked, but no one answered. I begged, but no one answered. I even crawled into that tight space, closing myself in…but nothing happened.\\n\\nThe prince in my daughter’s closet had stolen her away. I didn’t sleep, curling up on the wet carpet and waiting for something, anything, to happen. Then I realized something… and sat down to write my story. People will notice we’re missing soon; they’ll probably think I did something unspeakable because the truth is unbelievable.\\n\\nThe ring was on the wrong hand. She told me this, before the prince took her away. Maybe he was impatient for my answer. He asked me to marry him, after all. We’re going to live together in his castle. Sarina is waiting for me there; she couldn’t wait any longer.\\n\\nI can hear her singing now, with a song that erases my every doubt:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;*Skin as white as bone,*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Lips as red as blood.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Sitting on a throne*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Made of sticks and mud.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Daddy Prince loves you,*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Daddy Prince loves me.*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*...and I’ll love you, too*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*We’ll be family.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDon’t look for us.\\n\\nBut if you must… [check the closet.](https://www.youtube.com/pennytailsup)',\n",

Apparently, this conversation was going to happen, whether I was ready or not.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry honey. We’re going to stay here; this is our home.

Blake didn’t want kids; he’d made that abundantly clear. I wasn’t about to reach out to him after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Maybe,” I said. Saying ‘no’ seemed too harsh. “But I like things the way they are right now.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He told me he wants to already.” she insisted, “and he gave you a present.” my stomach twisted with a weird flutter of discomfort. Her insistence was genuine, and I found the fantasy disturbing.

I wanted to go back to my room and hide under the covers. I couldn’t deal with any more questions, not even one. As though she sensed this, my daughter went back to her room. I could hear her playing, leaving me to scrub syrup off the table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I went to check on her later, she was standing in the dark and lightly knocking on the castle wardrobe. &lt;em&gt;Tap tap tap,&lt;/em&gt; then pausing as if she waited for an answer. Naturally, she didn’t get one. Sarina saw me looking and smiled bashfully.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He said he sleeps during the day.” she explained, “but I wanted to tell him the good news.” I assumed she meant ‘Daddy Prince’.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What good news?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarina didn’t say anything, staring so intently at the closet doors that I thought she must not have heard me. I flicked on her bedroom light, which got her attention.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t! He doesn’t like the light on.” I decided to humor her and turned it back off. I was a little concerned about the prince character she was concocting. What sort of prince preferred the dark? Then again, she’d said he was sleeping. Kid logic is irrefutable at that age, so I let it go. You learn to pick your battles as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving her to her to play, I sat at the kitchen table to pay bills and balance my checkbook. I lived paycheck to paycheck and had to pay things strategically. I could afford to pay late on some bills, but not on others. How nice it would be, if there really was a prince ready to sweep in and take care of my problems. If only.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarina kept to her room. When I went to get her for lunch, she was still sitting in the dark. She’d changed into one of her costume dresses; mint green satin and tulle, with a plastic crown and ribbon-wrapped scepter. Her subjects were strewn about the room, face down: barbies, mostly, but also a few stuffed animals. Normally, I wouldn’t think twice about a scene like this… but it was a little odd when the lights were off with the curtains closed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s dark in here, honey. Are you sure you don’t want it on?” The only light came from the hallway, a yellow square of light that fell across my daughter’s small form. She beamed at me, clearly having a blast with her game.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want the lights.” she said, “Can I eat in my room? I’m not done playing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Alright. Come get it. Don’t forget to rinse your plate when you’re done.”  Sarina was usually a bit more energetic, ripping through the house and demanding near constant attention. I was a little unnerved, but also relieved to have a small break. Her preoccupation would enable me to finish my errands and get the house in order, no small feat with a young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarina skipped into the dining room, grabbed her plate, then paused suddenly. Her dark eyes fixed on the table for a moment, before she looked at me in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where are the flowers? You said you liked them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re drying out, princess.” I smiled at her, gesturing towards the window. “They were a little wet.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh.” she looked disappointed but didn’t say anything else. Plate in hand, she went back to her room. I heard the door close behind her. For some reason, I wanted to cry. I ate my lunch alone at the table, then went to retrieve the flowers. I brought them to the sink; the stems were tangled. Carefully, I worked them apart and rinsed away the clump of dirt holding them together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A metallic clink caught my attention. Something had come loose from the dirt and fallen into the sink… a ring? A muddy, tarnished ring. I picked it up, then held it under running water. It was missing a stone, and the filigree band was slightly bent… with a little love it could be beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It looked very old; I didn’t know if it was valuable or not, but it was probably important to someone. I slipped the ring onto my right ring finger so I wouldn’t lose it, intending to find the owner later. I couldn’t help but think about the conversation I’d had during breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Looks like he proposed after all.” I laughed, amused by the coincidence. Of course, my daughter found the flowers with a ring tangled in their roots. I dropped the flowers in a bowl on the table, making a sad excuse for a centerpiece. I didn’t add water; they were wet enough already. Apparently, Sarina’s Prince Charming lived in a swamp.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarina stayed in her room until dinner. By then, the house was tidy, and my errands were done. When I went to get Sarina, the door was closed, and the lights were off. I knocked lightly on the door before opening it, to find my daughter standing at the castle wardrobe. The double doors were open, and she was leaning forward, peering inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned on the light, causing her to glare at me. “Turn the lights OFF, mommy!” I didn’t, not liking the tone she was taking with me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Go wash up for dinner. Now.” when she didn’t start marching, I began to count. “1….” she crossed her arms, “2…” she stomped her foot, but before I could get to three the stormed past me-- slamming the door behind her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wardrobe was still open, so I walked over to close it. The carpet was wet, soaking through my slippers, squishing with every step. As I moved to close the closet, I saw something. A pale face, crowned with golden curls and forget-me-not eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Blake?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But my ex was not crouching in his daughter’s closet. There was nothing there, except a selection of dress up clothes and plastic jewelry. The face was gone almost as soon as I’d seen it, leaving a hollow ache in my chest. I closed the doors and stood there for a long moment in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner was cold by the time I ladled it onto our plates. I didn’t even remember walking back to the kitchen. Sarina pushed noodles around with her fork but didn’t eat them. We didn’t talk. I felt like some part of me had checked out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mommy?” her voice pulled me back. I looked up to see her smiling at me. Relieved that the storm had passed, I smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What is it, sweetheart?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re wearing the ring.” I looked down at my hands, and suddenly remembered the sorry little thing I was wearing on my right hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, only for safekeeping.” I answered, “I need to find the owner. I didn’t want to lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarina giggled. “&lt;em&gt;You’re&lt;/em&gt; the owner, silly!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll hold onto it, for now.” I answered, reaching over to tousle her dark curls. Her hair was damp, which gave me pause.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why is your hair wet?” I asked. Sarina slouched in her chair and went back to moving food around her plate. “The carpet was wet too.” I added softly, keeping my voice quiet and non-confrontational. My little girl didn’t look up, keeping her head down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can you tell me why?” she pushed her plate away, getting up from the table and running down the hall. I heard her bedroom door slam moments later. I buried my head in my hands and took a few deep breaths, giving myself a moment before I stood and walked over to the sink to rinse off our barely touched plates. Once the kitchen was clean, I grabbed the rag towels from under the sink so I could blot Sarina’s wet carpet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her door was closed, so I knocked before opening. Sarina was in bed, the blankets pulled up to her chin. The lights were off, the closet doors were ajar. My daughter was acting strange, with her eyes squeezed tightly shut. I could see her forehead furrowed from the effort as she pretended to be asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want me to read you a bedtime story first?” I asked her softly as I dropped the towels on the floor. Brownish, reddish stains spread across the rags-- like murky rust. The smell was bad too, like mildew and rot. “...I’ll rent a carpet cleaner tomorrow. Try not to track in any more mud, it’s hard to clean.” I did my best not to sound angry, but there was a quiver in my voice. I wanted to cry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blotted up the mess as best I could, spraying down the area with carpet cleaner and ruining towels in the process. Muddy carpets shouldn’t have been a breaking point for me, but with my daughter feigning sleep only feet away... I was weak. Why was everything so hard? Every obstacle broke me. I was a bad mother; weak, broken and alone. As much as I pretended everything was alright, nothing was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mommy.” Sarina spoke softly, startling me back to attention. “I want you to be happy. You’re sad all the time.” I looked up; she was sitting up in bed now. She looked past me, at the closet. The doors were still open, but I didn’t see any phantom exes peering back at us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I know sweetie. I’m sorry, I’m doing my best.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re wearing it on the wrong hand.” she answered, flopping back into her pillows and pulling the blankets up to her nose. I didn’t know what she meant, but she closed her eyes again. I stood up, kissing her on the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Goodnight.” my throat felt tight but having a breakdown in her room wasn’t the answer. I needed to get some rest. I was tired, that’s all. I moved to close the wardrobe, surprised to meet resistance. The doors didn’t close.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Leave it open. Daddy Prince likes to watch over me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was too tired to argue and left to take a long shower. The stink of the mud was sticking to me, even when I used my most fragrant soaps. After I was done, wrapped up in the only clean towel, I passed my daughter’s room on the way to mine. As I peered inside, something stopped me in my tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A white gloved hand, beckoning from the closet… and Sarina’s small hand reaching out to take it, before she was violently pulled into the wardrobe with a loud &lt;em&gt;snap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sarina!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into the bedroom just as the doors slammed shut. I pulled on the handles, alarmed by the deafening silence. My daughter didn’t answer my cries; she didn’t make a sound. When I managed to pry the doors open, the closet was empty. Even her dress-up clothes were gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I screamed, but no one answered. I knocked, but no one answered. I begged, but no one answered. I even crawled into that tight space, closing myself in…but nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The prince in my daughter’s closet had stolen her away. I didn’t sleep, curling up on the wet carpet and waiting for something, anything, to happen. Then I realized something… and sat down to write my story. People will notice we’re missing soon; they’ll probably think I did something unspeakable because the truth is unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The ring was on the wrong hand. She told me this, before the prince took her away. Maybe he was impatient for my answer. He asked me to marry him, after all. We’re going to live together in his castle. Sarina is waiting for me there; she couldn’t wait any longer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can hear her singing now, with a song that erases my every doubt:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skin as white as bone,&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lips as red as blood.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sitting on a throne&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made of sticks and mud.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Prince loves you,&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Prince loves me.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...and I’ll love you, too&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll be family.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t look for us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But if you must… &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/pennytailsup\"&gt;check the closet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Michael, James and I had been friends since elementary school. We’d always find time to hang out, despite the increasingly busy schedule and discovery of the opposite sex. We had been particularly busy with work lately and hung out less and less often, so Michael suggested we go camping for the weekend. James and I agreed without even giving it a second thought. We loved camping and this was a good opportunity to get drunk together again without interruptions.\\n\\nI picked them up on Friday afternoon and when I asked Michael where we are going to camp, he said that it was the same place his granddad used to camp in and that it was highly secluded, meaning no one would be bothering us. Took us a few hours to get there, but when we did, we took our stuff and followed Michael deeper into the woods. We walked for about an hour and it had started to get dark. James and I were a little agitated having to walk for so long to Michael’s special spot, but just as we were about to tell him that this was as good a spot as any, he told us we’re here.\\xa0\\n\\nIt was a big clearing, giving us a lot of visibility and room to set up our tents. After unpacking, we cooked some food and drank beer, reminiscing of the old days and exchanging news. James talked about how he wanted to become a police officer and we ridiculed him a little bit for kicks, but after we’ve had our laughs telling him he’ll need to arrest himself first for everything he’s done in the past, we expressed our support for him. \\n\\nMichael shrugged, not knowing what he wanted in life. Right now he was happy with a 9-5 job and just didn’t care about anything more than stability. They were about to ask me about my plans when we heard a high-pitched scream echo in the distance. We instinctively turned our heads in the direction of the sound, but saw nothing. I asked Michael, who was a more experienced camper what that was, but he said he didn’t know. We brainstormed what kind of animal it could be, but after a while let it go. We continued talking for a while around the campfire, getting ready to call it a day.\\n\\nJust then, I saw movement in the trees with my peripheral vision. I thought it must\\'ve been my imagination, because when I turned my head there I saw only rows of trees. I shrugged it off and continued to listen to James’ story. Both he and Michael seemed to not notice anything.\\n\\nA few minutes went by and I had a nagging feeling, something I just couldn’t shake away. I looked at the row of trees to my right again and still, there was nothing. Still, looking there made me feel uneasy. I decided to ignore my gut, dismissing it as my own paranoia. Not 5 minutes go by and the feeling of dread only intensified. I looked to my right again and stopped in bafflement. A few feet in front of the row of trees stood a lone, very thin tree, separated from the rest in the clearing. I squinted my eyes, trying to figure if my brain was playing tricks on me from excessive beer consumption. Was that tree there all along?\\n\\nWait. Holy shit.\\n\\nThat’s not a tree. It just moved slightly. I blinked and continued staring, transfixed at whatever stood there. The longer I stared the more apparent it became that it was no tree I was looking at. It was someone, or rather something. Something too thin to be human and too tall to be an animal. I grabbed Michael’s attention and when he looked at the figure, he went pale instantly. He silently muttered \\'oh shit\\' to himself.\\n\\n“Don’t look at it!” – he said – “Guys, listen to me. Do not look at it. If it comes near us, don’t acknowledge it, don’t talk to it, just keep your eyes on each other. Got it?!”\\n\\nTo say I was scared shitless is an understatement.\\n\\n“Michael, what the hell is that?” – I asked.\\n\\n“Quiet. Just look at me and don’t move your eyes away, alright?” – he said with a trembling voice.\\n\\nI looked over to James, who was silently staring at the campfire. Everything was quiet. In fact it was too quiet and I only realized it just now. No sounds came at all, save for the crackling of the fire. We stared like that in silence for what felt like ages, when suddenly another sound appeared in the distance. A branch cracked, as if someone had stepped on it. From there we heard the thuds of very slow footsteps, followed by the rustling of leaves on the ground, coming from my right side.\\n\\nIn seconds, I saw something emerge in the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t make out what it was. Michael motioned with his index finger for us to look at him and so we did. The figure slowly stepped behind Michael and I could see with my limited line of sight that the creature was extremely thin, not even fit for the word emaciated. It looked like a real-life stick figure. It was tall, easily towering over Michael and probably even more than I anticipated, but I wouldn’t dare look up. It looked like its body had been made from roots and branches. Slowly, the creature bent down with a creaking noise and put its head next to Michael’s. I felt its penetrating gaze on me, but I stared right into Michael’s eyes, who was tearing up by this point. I could see the creature smiling with my peripheral vision and it was almost irresistible to glance at the creature just for a second, but I managed not to do it.\\n\\nThe figure stood up, creaking equally and stayed behind Michael for a few seconds, completely still, before it turned around and went the other way around. It was coming in my direction and I felt like I was about to piss my pants. It came behind me and I heard its footsteps stop. Then, the creaking sound followed and I knew it was bending down. I closed my eyes and breathed out quietly, trembling like a leaf on wind. And then all of a sudden, I heard a frantic set of footsteps to my left. I opened my eyes and glanced to the left, seeing James running away.\\n\\nThere was a high-pitched scream behind me and then the creature ran after James, its footsteps impossibly quick.\\n\\n“On me!” – Michael reminded me during the commotion.\\n\\nI looked back at him and listened as the creature caught up to James, who managed to let out a short scream before he was silenced. What ensued was the sound of loud screeching,\\xa0 bashing, slamming and mauling to my left, while Michael and I stared at each other. It lasted for a whole minute before it abated and the blood-curdling screaming stopped completely. Silence once again filled the air around us and I heard the slow and soft footsteps to my left. They gradually faded and then completely disappeared.\\n\\nMichael and I continued glaring at each other, too paralyzed with fear to avert our gaze. Only when we started to hear the wildlife in the forest again, Michael suggested we get the fuck out of there. He told me not to look to my left, not because I might see James’ body, but because he didn’t wanna risk the creature still being around.\\n\\nWe left all our shit in the camp and bolted out of there. The creature left in the opposite direction, so we hoped we wouldn’t run into it, but we didn’t care about ignoring it at this point. We heard a loud shriek in the distance, which indicated the monster was far away from us, which put us at lease momentarily. Still though, that scream was enough to freeze the marrow of the bone. We reached the car much faster than we got to the campsite and once we got in, I clumsily pulled out my keys, almost dropping them on the floor while trying to put them in the ignition. We drove out of there with a cloud of dust behind us, both of us shaking.\\n\\n“Michael, what the fuck was that thing? “ – I asked while going as fast as the road allowed me to.\\n\\n“I… I don’t know.” – he muttered, still pale - \"My grandfather told me about it a few times but... I thought those were just stories... He said that the creature can only hurt you if you let it know you see it.\"\\n\\n“Poor James…” – I said, glancing in the rearview mirror every few seconds, half-expecting that thing to appear in the reflection.\\n\\nLuckily, it never did and Michael and I made it out safely. We went straight to the police and reported the whole thing, to their skepticism. I can’t blame them, a couple of drunk guys barge in in the middle of the night, telling them about a fucking stick figure that killed their friend in the woods. After some convincing, they decided to send a patrol to the spot. An investigation was started when the police quickly found James’ body. They said he had been mauled so badly that   \\nthey couldn’t identify him. They concluded it was a bear attack, dismissing our story of the stick figure, threatening that we weren\\'t suspects right now, but that it could change very quickly, so Michael and I dropped it.\\n\\nI don’t go camping anymore. And if you do, make sure you know where you’re going, or else you might end up like James.  [Or worse.](https://www.facebook.com/Scary-stories-with-BB-425929694662199/)',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael, James and I had been friends since elementary school. We’d always find time to hang out, despite the increasingly busy schedule and discovery of the opposite sex. We had been particularly busy with work lately and hung out less and less often, so Michael suggested we go camping for the weekend. James and I agreed without even giving it a second thought. We loved camping and this was a good opportunity to get drunk together again without interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I picked them up on Friday afternoon and when I asked Michael where we are going to camp, he said that it was the same place his granddad used to camp in and that it was highly secluded, meaning no one would be bothering us. Took us a few hours to get there, but when we did, we took our stuff and followed Michael deeper into the woods. We walked for about an hour and it had started to get dark. James and I were a little agitated having to walk for so long to Michael’s special spot, but just as we were about to tell him that this was as good a spot as any, he told us we’re here.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a big clearing, giving us a lot of visibility and room to set up our tents. After unpacking, we cooked some food and drank beer, reminiscing of the old days and exchanging news. James talked about how he wanted to become a police officer and we ridiculed him a little bit for kicks, but after we’ve had our laughs telling him he’ll need to arrest himself first for everything he’s done in the past, we expressed our support for him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Michael shrugged, not knowing what he wanted in life. Right now he was happy with a 9-5 job and just didn’t care about anything more than stability. They were about to ask me about my plans when we heard a high-pitched scream echo in the distance. We instinctively turned our heads in the direction of the sound, but saw nothing. I asked Michael, who was a more experienced camper what that was, but he said he didn’t know. We brainstormed what kind of animal it could be, but after a while let it go. We continued talking for a while around the campfire, getting ready to call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, I saw movement in the trees with my peripheral vision. I thought it must&amp;#39;ve been my imagination, because when I turned my head there I saw only rows of trees. I shrugged it off and continued to listen to James’ story. Both he and Michael seemed to not notice anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes went by and I had a nagging feeling, something I just couldn’t shake away. I looked at the row of trees to my right again and still, there was nothing. Still, looking there made me feel uneasy. I decided to ignore my gut, dismissing it as my own paranoia. Not 5 minutes go by and the feeling of dread only intensified. I looked to my right again and stopped in bafflement. A few feet in front of the row of trees stood a lone, very thin tree, separated from the rest in the clearing. I squinted my eyes, trying to figure if my brain was playing tricks on me from excessive beer consumption. Was that tree there all along?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Wait. Holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That’s not a tree. It just moved slightly. I blinked and continued staring, transfixed at whatever stood there. The longer I stared the more apparent it became that it was no tree I was looking at. It was someone, or rather something. Something too thin to be human and too tall to be an animal. I grabbed Michael’s attention and when he looked at the figure, he went pale instantly. He silently muttered &amp;#39;oh shit&amp;#39; to himself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t look at it!” – he said – “Guys, listen to me. Do not look at it. If it comes near us, don’t acknowledge it, don’t talk to it, just keep your eyes on each other. Got it?!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To say I was scared shitless is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, what the hell is that?” – I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Quiet. Just look at me and don’t move your eyes away, alright?” – he said with a trembling voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over to James, who was silently staring at the campfire. Everything was quiet. In fact it was too quiet and I only realized it just now. No sounds came at all, save for the crackling of the fire. We stared like that in silence for what felt like ages, when suddenly another sound appeared in the distance. A branch cracked, as if someone had stepped on it. From there we heard the thuds of very slow footsteps, followed by the rustling of leaves on the ground, coming from my right side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In seconds, I saw something emerge in the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t make out what it was. Michael motioned with his index finger for us to look at him and so we did. The figure slowly stepped behind Michael and I could see with my limited line of sight that the creature was extremely thin, not even fit for the word emaciated. It looked like a real-life stick figure. It was tall, easily towering over Michael and probably even more than I anticipated, but I wouldn’t dare look up. It looked like its body had been made from roots and branches. Slowly, the creature bent down with a creaking noise and put its head next to Michael’s. I felt its penetrating gaze on me, but I stared right into Michael’s eyes, who was tearing up by this point. I could see the creature smiling with my peripheral vision and it was almost irresistible to glance at the creature just for a second, but I managed not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The figure stood up, creaking equally and stayed behind Michael for a few seconds, completely still, before it turned around and went the other way around. It was coming in my direction and I felt like I was about to piss my pants. It came behind me and I heard its footsteps stop. Then, the creaking sound followed and I knew it was bending down. I closed my eyes and breathed out quietly, trembling like a leaf on wind. And then all of a sudden, I heard a frantic set of footsteps to my left. I opened my eyes and glanced to the left, seeing James running away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a high-pitched scream behind me and then the creature ran after James, its footsteps impossibly quick.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“On me!” – Michael reminded me during the commotion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back at him and listened as the creature caught up to James, who managed to let out a short scream before he was silenced. What ensued was the sound of loud screeching,\\xa0 bashing, slamming and mauling to my left, while Michael and I stared at each other. It lasted for a whole minute before it abated and the blood-curdling screaming stopped completely. Silence once again filled the air around us and I heard the slow and soft footsteps to my left. They gradually faded and then completely disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Michael and I continued glaring at each other, too paralyzed with fear to avert our gaze. Only when we started to hear the wildlife in the forest again, Michael suggested we get the fuck out of there. He told me not to look to my left, not because I might see James’ body, but because he didn’t wanna risk the creature still being around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We left all our shit in the camp and bolted out of there. The creature left in the opposite direction, so we hoped we wouldn’t run into it, but we didn’t care about ignoring it at this point. We heard a loud shriek in the distance, which indicated the monster was far away from us, which put us at lease momentarily. Still though, that scream was enough to freeze the marrow of the bone. We reached the car much faster than we got to the campsite and once we got in, I clumsily pulled out my keys, almost dropping them on the floor while trying to put them in the ignition. We drove out of there with a cloud of dust behind us, both of us shaking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Michael, what the fuck was that thing? “ – I asked while going as fast as the road allowed me to.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I… I don’t know.” – he muttered, still pale - &amp;quot;My grandfather told me about it a few times but... I thought those were just stories... He said that the creature can only hurt you if you let it know you see it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Poor James…” – I said, glancing in the rearview mirror every few seconds, half-expecting that thing to appear in the reflection.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it never did and Michael and I made it out safely. We went straight to the police and reported the whole thing, to their skepticism. I can’t blame them, a couple of drunk guys barge in in the middle of the night, telling them about a fucking stick figure that killed their friend in the woods. After some convincing, they decided to send a patrol to the spot. An investigation was started when the police quickly found James’ body. They said he had been mauled so badly that&lt;br/&gt;\\nthey couldn’t identify him. They concluded it was a bear attack, dismissing our story of the stick figure, threatening that we weren&amp;#39;t suspects right now, but that it could change very quickly, so Michael and I dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t go camping anymore. And if you do, make sure you know where you’re going, or else you might end up like James.  &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Scary-stories-with-BB-425929694662199/\"&gt;Or worse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I have a temper.  I hate it.  It boils beneath my skin and I shatter with the slightest injury.  My poison consumes every relationship I have, damaging the ones it doesn’t kill outright.  Finally, I hit a point where I was *done* with it, when I found myself staring in the mirror and hating the person I saw.  My temper turned on myself and I punched the glass, not caring if it shattered, thinking I *deserved* it if I did, that maybe *I* should hurt because of my actions for once.\\n\\nThe mirror did not shatter and looking back, I’m thankful for that.  But the pain in my knuckles brought me back to myself and I sat down at the computer and found a therapist that would take my insurance and scheduled an appointment.\\n\\nIt worked a little, but slowly, and I began to grow agitated during our sessions.  I felt helpless when my anger tore free, like I was merely an observer watching some horrific stranger act out my part.  My therapist kept reminding me that this took time and I told her that I needed help *now*, that this was going to affect my career if it kept up.\\n\\nShe gave me a referral to a local doctor.  I’ll call him Dr. Coe.  He had an unconventional treatment, she said, one that yielded quick results.  She’d referred other patients to him and they’d always returned with marvelous changes.  I called his office and the receptionist scheduled an appointment.  I could at least hear him out, I thought.\\n\\nDr. Coe’s office was sedately boring, located in a cluster of other medical offices on the edge of an upscale suburb.  The interior was like every other doctor’s office, save for the paintings.  Instead of flowers or puppies or inspirational sayings, the walls were hung with abstract canvases, streaked with jagged swathes of color.  Reds and black and oranges - aggressive, primal colors that demanded the viewer’s attention.  I tore my eyes from them and focused on checking in with the receptionist.  She took my name and then directed me back to Dr. Coe’s office.  \\n\\nThis surprised me.  No wait.  How many doctors - specialists, no less - had no wait?\\n\\nThe receptionist led me to a spacious office near the back corner of the building.  The window was curtained, blocking out the sunlight and giving the room the intimate feel of a library.  I absently lowered my voice as I introduced myself.\\n\\nDr. Coe was younger than I expected, perhaps in his mid-thirties, dressed in a crisp charcoal button-down under a white labcoat.  He came around the desk and shook my hand.  His grip was strong and his palm felt weathered.  He wore glasses and I caught glimpses of a sharp, calculated gaze from behind the lenses.  He asked that I sit at some plush chairs in one corner, beside a round coffee table.  A slightly more informal setting than the narrow wooden chairs in front of his desk.\\n\\nMy chair was positioned so that it faced a painting on the wall near the door.  It was rendered in grayscale, vertical streaks that reached almost to the top of the canvas, irregular and tilting to one side.\\n\\n“What do you see?” Dr. Coe asked, noticing what I was looking at.\\n\\n“A dead city,” I said, startled by my response.  \\n\\nDr. Coe raised an eyebrow and I felt compelled to continue.  I explained in awkward, stumbling phrases that I saw the dark outlines of the buildings reaching for the edge of the canvas like fingers, but there was no light in those solid streaks of paint, only the vacant shells of long-abandoned structures.\\n\\n“Everyone sees something different,” Dr. Coe said pleasantly.  “That’s what I like about it.  Most people find it unsettling and perhaps that isn’t what you would expect out of a medical office - but you’re not here to be reassured, are you?  You’re here to be *cured.*”\\n\\nI felt something inside me unknot.  I laughed weakly, surprised by the relief flooding me.  He understood.  He wasn’t going to tell me that I just had to *try* harder or that change took time or any other empty platitudes.  He was going to address my desperation.\\n\\nHis procedure removed unwanted personality traits, he explained.  It was part medicine and part… something else.  I scoffed instinctively at this and he only gave me a thin smile and slid a sheet of paper over to me.  References, he said.  People that have been in my situation.  I could call any of them.  It was a long list.  I hesitated to take it.\\n\\nHe understood my skepticism, he said.  He told me to go home and think about it.  Call every name on that list if I wanted to.  If I decided to go ahead with the procedure, I could call the receptionist and make an appointment for the pre-surgery consultation.\\n\\nI didn’t know what to think of it all.  Some alternative medicine garbage, I reasoned, and I took the list and left.  It sat on my kitchen counter for a few days before I bothered to call any of the numbers listed.  I called the first on a whim, thinking I’d see how ridiculous this was.  A woman picked up and after I told her why I was calling, she began to gush about how Dr. Coe had gotten rid of her paranoia and how much *better* her life was now.  I called another and they told me that their jealousy was gone.  Someone else was free of their anxiety.  And so on and so on.  Dozens of people, all telling the same story of how they didn’t believe him at first but were desperate enough to try anything.  Miraculous results, they all said.\\n\\nI went through the entire list and then I sat there on my sofa for a long time.\\xa0 Too many people to be hired actors.  Too much genuine emotion in their stories to be fakes.  \\n\\nDr. Coe had discussed cost with me in our brief meeting.  The procedure was not covered by insurance and it would be around six-thousand dollars.  I had the money in savings, but it was still a lot to pay.\\n\\nI’m a skeptical person.  Yet the more I dug, the more it started to seem like the reasonable choice.  Dr. Coe’s credentials checked out.  He was a neurosurgeon, still licensed to practice, and had extensive experience in his field before starting his own office.  I couldn’t find any record of him appearing before the medical board for improper conduct of any kind.  I wrestled with it for days and then finally, I called his office and scheduled a surgery date and a consultation.\\n\\nThere was again no wait when I went in to discuss the procedure with him.  He said this was because he understood people were coming to him with delicate problems and wanted to ensure patient privacy.  He scheduled a buffer, he said.  He wasn’t like *other* doctors that merely tried to process as many people as they could in a day.  His voice was low and scornful.\\n\\nThen he explained that he’d done a little research on my situation.  He already knew my name, but now he knew my address, where I worked, and many other minute details of my life that he had no right to know.  I felt cold and afraid when he finished reciting them, a precise summation of who I was, delivered with ruthless efficiency.  I could only stare at his face, stunned, fixated by the calculating gaze that had lost all of its prior warmth.\\n\\n“There are… irregularities in how I conduct my practice,” he said after a long moment of silence.  “I like to be certain that my clients are genuine and *committed*.”\\n\\nThen he smiled, his expression softened, and he gently told me that there was nothing to be afraid of, that the procedure was safe and effective.  It’s hard to explain why I trusted him.  It felt like I’d passed some sort of test just to be here.  It made me feel special.  And more, Dr. Coe exuded confidence and authority, a soft sort of charisma that made me feel safe.  I’m sure you’ve met these kinds of people before.  There were glimpses of cunning as well, when I caught him studying me from across the desk - but even then, I felt that I was *meant* to see that, like he was allowing me a brief look at who he was and that rare vulnerability put me even more at ease.\\n\\nPerhaps I was being manipulated… but I’m still not certain if I made a mistake in trusting him.\\n\\nI balked only when he explained that I would be put under twilight sedation.  I’ve not had very many medical procedures and I confessed that I was frightened, when he paused and asked if something was wrong.  There would be a nurse present, he said, and while it was not explicitly stated I understood that this was meant to reassure me that I would not be left alone with him while under sedation.  Moreover, twilight sedation was a gentle form of sedation, commonly used in small surgeries, and did not require intensive monitoring.  It’d be dosed in ten minute increments and all he had to do to bring me out of it was to stop giving it to me.\\n\\n“One thing I need to know,” he said, looking at me from over the rim of his thin glasses.  “Your anger.  Where do you feel it?”\\n\\nMy chest, I told him.  In the middle, near the top of my sternum.  It felt like I was suffocating under its weight.\\n\\n“Then the procedure will be a small incision in that spot,” he said.  “Perhaps an inch, at most.  It’ll barely leave a scar.”\\n\\nHis receptionist was waiting outside.  I filled out some paperwork, was given a packet of instructions, and paid in advance.  The surgery was scheduled for a week out and there would be a follow-up a week later.  Plenty of time to arrange for time off work and for someone to drive me home.  \\n\\nI prepared carefully the morning of the procedure, as I’d been instructed.  I wore loose, comfortable clothing.  A friend drove me.  I didn’t tell her much about it and she didn’t ask questions.  When we arrived, the receptionist told me to head back to Dr. Coe’s office.  My friend sat down and began to read her book.\\n\\nDr. Coe stood as I entered.  He looked unhappy.\\n\\n“I tried to call earlier,” he said.  “My nurse isn’t available today.”\\n\\nI glanced down at my phone - one missed call.  I silently cursed my negligence.\\n\\n“We can reschedule, of course,” he continued, turning his attention to the computer screen.  “The procedure *is* simple enough that one person can manage it, but I do recall that you were nervous about being sedated…”\\n\\n“It’s fine,” I said abruptly.  \\n\\nThis was stupid, I thought.  He had impeccable references.  I’d already made so many arrangements to make this work.  And more - I felt like if I backed out now, I wouldn’t ever come back.  My heart hammered in my chest and he stared at me across the desk, his eyes narrowing as he studied me intently.  Gauging my conviction.\\n\\n“All right,” he finally said, and he closed the laptop.  “Honestly, all she really does is keep an eye on the timer and add another increment of the sedation.”\\n\\nHe led me to another room further down the hallway.  A small changing room with a locker for my belongings.  I’d need to wear a hospital gown, he explained, but I could leave my sweatpants on.  I changed, put my clothing in the locker, and then returned to the hallway.  He led me to the last room in the building.  It was long, lined with countertops and cabinets, with two medical examination chairs in the middle - the sort you’d see at a dentist.  I frowned at the two of them and he just smiled and explained that the room was originally divided into two, but he’d wanted more space and just hadn’t had the other chair taken out yet.  Reassured, I took a seat in the one on the left as he directed while he prepped the IV.\\n\\nThere was nothing unusual in the procedure.  At least, not at first.  He put the IV in, started the saline, and then talked me through the initial sedation.  Like falling asleep, he said.  That’s all.  \\n\\nAnd it was.\\n\\nBut I remember a brief moment - of being aware of the lights overhead - and realizing that the sedation was wearing off.  It was strange, though, because while I was *aware*, I didn’t feel anything, and I didn’t seem to *care*.  I wasn’t frightened or upset.  I simply existed there in that chair with the light shining on my face.  I turned my head slightly - and it was so hard to move - and then I saw the other chair.\\n\\nThere was someone in it.  Another person.  Plastic tubing stretched between us, held in place on their chest by thin clamps around the edges of an open incision on their sternum.\\n\\nThen Dr. Coe flickered into view, I watched as his hands delicately manipulated the IV line, and then I was gone again.\\n\\nMy friend took me home and made sure I was comfortable on my sofa.  She put some pillows behind my back, saying that Dr. Coe had briefed her and that I should stay elevated for twenty-four hours and then sleep on my back for a few days after that.  Then she left me to nap, because I’d already proven that I could drink on my own without being sick, and when I woke up next I felt drowsy but that was all.  There were bandaids over the veins on both arms and a line of thin, dissolvable stitches along my chest.  I was to change the bandage for a few days and then leave it uncovered.\\n\\nI felt noticeably calmer in the days that followed.  I began to be hopeful that whatever Dr. Coe had done had *worked* and I was rid of that part of myself that I hated.  This was good, Dr. Coe said at the follow-up a week later.  Everything was going well.  He explained that there would be some side-effects of the procedure.  I might have moments of intense anger, but they wouldn’t be like the ones from before.  I’d feel different during them, as if it wasn’t *my* anger I was feeling, and I would be able to control it easier.  Those would diminish in time and after six months I’d be completely free of them.\\n\\nI thought about what I’d seen while under sedation, but I didn’t ask him what it was.  I wasn’t certain of my own memories, as drugged as I was at the time, and he was so in control of the appointment that I didn’t dare deviate from his script.  He noticed my hesitation, however, and told me I could always call with questions.\\n\\nWeeks passed.  I began to have the flashes of anger that Dr. Coe warned me about.  The first one hit while I was making dinner and I turned the heat on the stove off and stood there, staring at the wall, stunned by the mindless fury that boiled inside my chest.  It felt remote, however.  Detached.  Like I was observing it without fully feeling it, like I’d been cut off from my own emotion.  \\n\\nI blinked.  There was a brief impression of an image, of a wooden wall, rough and unpainted.\\n\\nThese episodes continued.  Perhaps two to three times a day, lasting only a few seconds.  The rest of the time I was free from my anger and I felt considerably more relaxed.  I interacted with the people around me easier and my coworkers noticed and even commented on how much… happier I seemed.  \\n\\nI began to keep my eyes closed when that strange, foreign anger came.  I saw the wall, again and again, and sometimes a dirt floor.  Then, one day while I sat at my desk at work, I saw something different.  I felt like I was looking *up* now, as someone stood over me.  I stared into Dr. Coe’s face, impassionate, remorseless - and he reached for me with one hand.\\n\\nMy eyes snapped open.  My heart pounded as the anger fled.\\n\\nI called his office.  Said there was something wrong.  He called me back within an hour.\\n\\n“I’m seeing things,” I told him.\\n\\n“That’s not an uncommon side-effect,” he replied calmly.  “It’ll pass along with the other emotions.”\\n\\nI wasn’t ready to be dismissed so easily.\\n\\n“There’s something else.  During the surgery I think I woke up and… I saw a person next to me.”\\n\\nA long pause.  My heart beat rapidly, afraid of how he would react.  I was glad we were doing this over the phone.  I couldn’t shake that brief impression I had of his face, terrifyingly dispassionate.\\n\\n“All part of the procedure,” he sighed.  “I was slow in administering the next dose of sedation.  I apologize.  Those images you’re seeing?  It’s of the interior of a barn.  I’ll give you the address.  Be there at seven tonight and I’ll explain the rest of the procedure.”\\n\\n“Am I really safe from you?” I whispered.\\n\\n“It’s the only way you’re going to get answers,” he replied and his tone was cold.  Then he hung up.\\n\\nI went.  I’m still not certain I can explain why.  Curiosity, I suppose, and a reckless belief that Dr. Coe *couldn’t* harm me in any way, not without jeopardizing his practice.  That perhaps this all would have a rational, reasonable explanation.\\n\\nThe address he’d given me over the phone led to a house well outside the city.  It was surrounded by fields and a line of trees, isolated from the main roads and the neighbors.  The house itself was large and well-maintained.  Dr. Coe was clearly doing well for himself.  The barn he’d told me about was further back behind the house and the driveway split off into a dirt path leading up to its doors.  Dr. Coe stood outside, dressed casually in jeans and a t-shirt.  It felt strange to see him like this.\\n\\n“Come inside,” he said as I approached, cracking one of the doors enough for a person to slip through.  “Stay near the center of the barn, okay?”\\n\\nHe went in first.  The interior was well-lit from large fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling.  The floor was packed dirt, swept clean of debris.  There was a strange, medical smell in the air, a chemical scent with not a hint of must.  Dr. Coe led me towards the middle of the barn, past the lines of horse stalls on either side.  I briefly stood on tiptoes as we passed one and inside I saw dark stains splattering the floor and walls. \\n\\nI almost fled.  But then Dr. Coe told me to come look inside one.  Just up to the wall, he said.  It’s safe so long as I didn’t enter the stall.\\n\\nI was inside.\\n\\nOr rather, something that looked exactly like me, down to the birthmark on my arm.  Naked and snarling in anger, lips peeled back, eyes wide and focused like some feral beast.  Her wrists were restrained with heavy chain, bolted to the wall behind her.  Her hands curled like claws and she made guttural noises in the back of her throat, muscles shivering.  Her skin was pale and her frame emaciated.\\n\\n“It’s not human,” Dr. Coe said, coming to stand next to me.  Her eyes flickered to him and remained fixed there.  “It’s a physical manifestation of what I removed from your soul.  Since I took your anger, well, that’s why it looks so angry.”\\n\\n“You created this… doppelganger?” I whispered.\\n\\n“Yes.  I told you, I use both medicine and something else to achieve my results.  I created the frame in advance of your appointment and then turned it into *you* with a sample of your blood during the procedure.  Then I transferred your anger to it.”\\n\\nI thought of the tubes stretching to its chest and of the incision in my own, just over the sternum, where I said I’d felt my anger.\\n\\n“What’s going to happen to it?”\\n\\n“I let it mature for a period of about six months, which should be enough time for you to stop having flashbacks to the part of you that was removed.  Then I kill it.”\\n\\n“How?”  \\n\\nI couldn’t help but ask.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to know, but I felt like I couldn’t stop now.  Pandora’s box was open and I had to see this through.\\n\\n“I starve them to death,” he said calmly.\\n\\nI felt I could drown in his words.  His confidence was soothing.  It was all that was keeping me from fleeing in terror.\\n\\n“They suffer, of course,” he continued, “but it’s an easier process on the patient.  Your anger will weaken gradually and by the time it dies, you’ll barely notice.  Please keep in mind that it is *not* human.  It isn’t really sentient.  It’s just your anger.  That’s all.”\\n\\nI asked if all of those stalls were designed to hold these things while they matured.  He said that they were.\\n\\n“And that stall?” I asked, pointing back towards the entrance.  “The one with the blood?”\\n\\n“Ah.  That.”  A rueful smile.  “Well, that one is the reason I need a new nurse.”\\n\\nI swallowed hard.  They were - unfortunately - dangerous, he continued.  Any extreme of emotion could erupt into violence, especially the negative ones that his clients were trying to rid themselves of.  Then he asked if I had any further questions in a prim sort of finality that indicated that he was quite done with having me here.\\n\\n“That’s it?” I asked, incredulous.  “You’re just letting me leave, after showing me this?”\\n\\nA look of annoyance crossed his face.\\n\\n“Good luck getting the police to investigate me, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said tersely.  “Besides - didn’t I help you?  Didn’t my procedure make your life *better*?”\\n\\nSometimes I stop and think that perhaps I should have done something at the time.  Should have contacted the authorities and invented a lie that would have given them reason to search the barn.  Yet Dr. Coe *had* helped me and so I kept silent and as time went on it became easier and easier to not do anything.  Complacency is seductive.\\n\\nYet… I saw something that is making me reconsider.\\n\\nSix months are almost up.  My doppelganger is going to die soon.  Dr. Coe will starve her to death and while I keep reminding myself that I shouldn’t feel sorry for something that isn’t entirely alive, I can’t help but think there’s something wrong about this.  Maybe that sympathy is why the episodes of anger aren’t dwindling away to nothing and why I keep seeing that barn stall where she’s chained.\\n\\nI’ve taken to closing my eyes and keeping them closed, trying to remain there as long as I can.  Maybe I’m keeping her company.  Or maybe I’m trying to understand how Dr. Coe has done this.\\n\\nYesterday he came to her (me).  He had gloves on and an empty IV bag.  I watched as he knelt next to her and I felt her struggling.  He reached for her, his expression remote and uncaring, just as it had been before.  I felt his fingers on her (my) arm, felt them dig in and force it to be still.  The bite of a needle and I watched the dark blood wind its way through the tubing and into that empty bag.\\n\\nI watched until it was full, watched him pull the needle and instead of gauze, he pressed his thumb over the vein.  Her blood seeped slowly out and then stopped.  He raised his hand, staring at the blood coating his glove, and then he licked it clean.  \\n\\nHis eyes closed.  His face went slack and he shuddered minutely, as if in relief.  Then he stood and walked away, taking the bag of blood with him, and then I was myself again and the barn was gone.\\n\\nThe safest thing to do is to forget about that place.  She will die soon and this will all be over.  So I’m posting this, perhaps to expunge it from my memories, and then I’m going to pretend that I never met Dr. Coe and go on living my life and being happy with who I am now.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a temper.  I hate it.  It boils beneath my skin and I shatter with the slightest injury.  My poison consumes every relationship I have, damaging the ones it doesn’t kill outright.  Finally, I hit a point where I was &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with it, when I found myself staring in the mirror and hating the person I saw.  My temper turned on myself and I punched the glass, not caring if it shattered, thinking I &lt;em&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt; it if I did, that maybe &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; should hurt because of my actions for once.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The mirror did not shatter and looking back, I’m thankful for that.  But the pain in my knuckles brought me back to myself and I sat down at the computer and found a therapist that would take my insurance and scheduled an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It worked a little, but slowly, and I began to grow agitated during our sessions.  I felt helpless when my anger tore free, like I was merely an observer watching some horrific stranger act out my part.  My therapist kept reminding me that this took time and I told her that I needed help &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, that this was going to affect my career if it kept up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a referral to a local doctor.  I’ll call him Dr. Coe.  He had an unconventional treatment, she said, one that yielded quick results.  She’d referred other patients to him and they’d always returned with marvelous changes.  I called his office and the receptionist scheduled an appointment.  I could at least hear him out, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coe’s office was sedately boring, located in a cluster of other medical offices on the edge of an upscale suburb.  The interior was like every other doctor’s office, save for the paintings.  Instead of flowers or puppies or inspirational sayings, the walls were hung with abstract canvases, streaked with jagged swathes of color.  Reds and black and oranges - aggressive, primal colors that demanded the viewer’s attention.  I tore my eyes from them and focused on checking in with the receptionist.  She took my name and then directed me back to Dr. Coe’s office.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This surprised me.  No wait.  How many doctors - specialists, no less - had no wait?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The receptionist led me to a spacious office near the back corner of the building.  The window was curtained, blocking out the sunlight and giving the room the intimate feel of a library.  I absently lowered my voice as I introduced myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coe was younger than I expected, perhaps in his mid-thirties, dressed in a crisp charcoal button-down under a white labcoat.  He came around the desk and shook my hand.  His grip was strong and his palm felt weathered.  He wore glasses and I caught glimpses of a sharp, calculated gaze from behind the lenses.  He asked that I sit at some plush chairs in one corner, beside a round coffee table.  A slightly more informal setting than the narrow wooden chairs in front of his desk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My chair was positioned so that it faced a painting on the wall near the door.  It was rendered in grayscale, vertical streaks that reached almost to the top of the canvas, irregular and tilting to one side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you see?” Dr. Coe asked, noticing what I was looking at.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“A dead city,” I said, startled by my response.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coe raised an eyebrow and I felt compelled to continue.  I explained in awkward, stumbling phrases that I saw the dark outlines of the buildings reaching for the edge of the canvas like fingers, but there was no light in those solid streaks of paint, only the vacant shells of long-abandoned structures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Everyone sees something different,” Dr. Coe said pleasantly.  “That’s what I like about it.  Most people find it unsettling and perhaps that isn’t what you would expect out of a medical office - but you’re not here to be reassured, are you?  You’re here to be &lt;em&gt;cured.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt something inside me unknot.  I laughed weakly, surprised by the relief flooding me.  He understood.  He wasn’t going to tell me that I just had to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; harder or that change took time or any other empty platitudes.  He was going to address my desperation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His procedure removed unwanted personality traits, he explained.  It was part medicine and part… something else.  I scoffed instinctively at this and he only gave me a thin smile and slid a sheet of paper over to me.  References, he said.  People that have been in my situation.  I could call any of them.  It was a long list.  I hesitated to take it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He understood my skepticism, he said.  He told me to go home and think about it.  Call every name on that list if I wanted to.  If I decided to go ahead with the procedure, I could call the receptionist and make an appointment for the pre-surgery consultation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to think of it all.  Some alternative medicine garbage, I reasoned, and I took the list and left.  It sat on my kitchen counter for a few days before I bothered to call any of the numbers listed.  I called the first on a whim, thinking I’d see how ridiculous this was.  A woman picked up and after I told her why I was calling, she began to gush about how Dr. Coe had gotten rid of her paranoia and how much &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; her life was now.  I called another and they told me that their jealousy was gone.  Someone else was free of their anxiety.  And so on and so on.  Dozens of people, all telling the same story of how they didn’t believe him at first but were desperate enough to try anything.  Miraculous results, they all said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went through the entire list and then I sat there on my sofa for a long time.\\xa0 Too many people to be hired actors.  Too much genuine emotion in their stories to be fakes.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coe had discussed cost with me in our brief meeting.  The procedure was not covered by insurance and it would be around six-thousand dollars.  I had the money in savings, but it was still a lot to pay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m a skeptical person.  Yet the more I dug, the more it started to seem like the reasonable choice.  Dr. Coe’s credentials checked out.  He was a neurosurgeon, still licensed to practice, and had extensive experience in his field before starting his own office.  I couldn’t find any record of him appearing before the medical board for improper conduct of any kind.  I wrestled with it for days and then finally, I called his office and scheduled a surgery date and a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was again no wait when I went in to discuss the procedure with him.  He said this was because he understood people were coming to him with delicate problems and wanted to ensure patient privacy.  He scheduled a buffer, he said.  He wasn’t like &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; doctors that merely tried to process as many people as they could in a day.  His voice was low and scornful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he explained that he’d done a little research on my situation.  He already knew my name, but now he knew my address, where I worked, and many other minute details of my life that he had no right to know.  I felt cold and afraid when he finished reciting them, a precise summation of who I was, delivered with ruthless efficiency.  I could only stare at his face, stunned, fixated by the calculating gaze that had lost all of its prior warmth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There are… irregularities in how I conduct my practice,” he said after a long moment of silence.  “I like to be certain that my clients are genuine and &lt;em&gt;committed&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he smiled, his expression softened, and he gently told me that there was nothing to be afraid of, that the procedure was safe and effective.  It’s hard to explain why I trusted him.  It felt like I’d passed some sort of test just to be here.  It made me feel special.  And more, Dr. Coe exuded confidence and authority, a soft sort of charisma that made me feel safe.  I’m sure you’ve met these kinds of people before.  There were glimpses of cunning as well, when I caught him studying me from across the desk - but even then, I felt that I was &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to see that, like he was allowing me a brief look at who he was and that rare vulnerability put me even more at ease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I was being manipulated… but I’m still not certain if I made a mistake in trusting him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I balked only when he explained that I would be put under twilight sedation.  I’ve not had very many medical procedures and I confessed that I was frightened, when he paused and asked if something was wrong.  There would be a nurse present, he said, and while it was not explicitly stated I understood that this was meant to reassure me that I would not be left alone with him while under sedation.  Moreover, twilight sedation was a gentle form of sedation, commonly used in small surgeries, and did not require intensive monitoring.  It’d be dosed in ten minute increments and all he had to do to bring me out of it was to stop giving it to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“One thing I need to know,” he said, looking at me from over the rim of his thin glasses.  “Your anger.  Where do you feel it?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My chest, I told him.  In the middle, near the top of my sternum.  It felt like I was suffocating under its weight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then the procedure will be a small incision in that spot,” he said.  “Perhaps an inch, at most.  It’ll barely leave a scar.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His receptionist was waiting outside.  I filled out some paperwork, was given a packet of instructions, and paid in advance.  The surgery was scheduled for a week out and there would be a follow-up a week later.  Plenty of time to arrange for time off work and for someone to drive me home.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I prepared carefully the morning of the procedure, as I’d been instructed.  I wore loose, comfortable clothing.  A friend drove me.  I didn’t tell her much about it and she didn’t ask questions.  When we arrived, the receptionist told me to head back to Dr. Coe’s office.  My friend sat down and began to read her book.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Coe stood as I entered.  He looked unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I tried to call earlier,” he said.  “My nurse isn’t available today.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced down at my phone - one missed call.  I silently cursed my negligence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We can reschedule, of course,” he continued, turning his attention to the computer screen.  “The procedure &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; simple enough that one person can manage it, but I do recall that you were nervous about being sedated…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s fine,” I said abruptly.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This was stupid, I thought.  He had impeccable references.  I’d already made so many arrangements to make this work.  And more - I felt like if I backed out now, I wouldn’t ever come back.  My heart hammered in my chest and he stared at me across the desk, his eyes narrowing as he studied me intently.  Gauging my conviction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“All right,” he finally said, and he closed the laptop.  “Honestly, all she really does is keep an eye on the timer and add another increment of the sedation.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led me to another room further down the hallway.  A small changing room with a locker for my belongings.  I’d need to wear a hospital gown, he explained, but I could leave my sweatpants on.  I changed, put my clothing in the locker, and then returned to the hallway.  He led me to the last room in the building.  It was long, lined with countertops and cabinets, with two medical examination chairs in the middle - the sort you’d see at a dentist.  I frowned at the two of them and he just smiled and explained that the room was originally divided into two, but he’d wanted more space and just hadn’t had the other chair taken out yet.  Reassured, I took a seat in the one on the left as he directed while he prepped the IV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was nothing unusual in the procedure.  At least, not at first.  He put the IV in, started the saline, and then talked me through the initial sedation.  Like falling asleep, he said.  That’s all.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I remember a brief moment - of being aware of the lights overhead - and realizing that the sedation was wearing off.  It was strange, though, because while I was &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt;, I didn’t feel anything, and I didn’t seem to &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;.  I wasn’t frightened or upset.  I simply existed there in that chair with the light shining on my face.  I turned my head slightly - and it was so hard to move - and then I saw the other chair.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was someone in it.  Another person.  Plastic tubing stretched between us, held in place on their chest by thin clamps around the edges of an open incision on their sternum.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Coe flickered into view, I watched as his hands delicately manipulated the IV line, and then I was gone again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My friend took me home and made sure I was comfortable on my sofa.  She put some pillows behind my back, saying that Dr. Coe had briefed her and that I should stay elevated for twenty-four hours and then sleep on my back for a few days after that.  Then she left me to nap, because I’d already proven that I could drink on my own without being sick, and when I woke up next I felt drowsy but that was all.  There were bandaids over the veins on both arms and a line of thin, dissolvable stitches along my chest.  I was to change the bandage for a few days and then leave it uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt noticeably calmer in the days that followed.  I began to be hopeful that whatever Dr. Coe had done had &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; and I was rid of that part of myself that I hated.  This was good, Dr. Coe said at the follow-up a week later.  Everything was going well.  He explained that there would be some side-effects of the procedure.  I might have moments of intense anger, but they wouldn’t be like the ones from before.  I’d feel different during them, as if it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; anger I was feeling, and I would be able to control it easier.  Those would diminish in time and after six months I’d be completely free of them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about what I’d seen while under sedation, but I didn’t ask him what it was.  I wasn’t certain of my own memories, as drugged as I was at the time, and he was so in control of the appointment that I didn’t dare deviate from his script.  He noticed my hesitation, however, and told me I could always call with questions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Weeks passed.  I began to have the flashes of anger that Dr. Coe warned me about.  The first one hit while I was making dinner and I turned the heat on the stove off and stood there, staring at the wall, stunned by the mindless fury that boiled inside my chest.  It felt remote, however.  Detached.  Like I was observing it without fully feeling it, like I’d been cut off from my own emotion.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked.  There was a brief impression of an image, of a wooden wall, rough and unpainted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;These episodes continued.  Perhaps two to three times a day, lasting only a few seconds.  The rest of the time I was free from my anger and I felt considerably more relaxed.  I interacted with the people around me easier and my coworkers noticed and even commented on how much… happier I seemed.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began to keep my eyes closed when that strange, foreign anger came.  I saw the wall, again and again, and sometimes a dirt floor.  Then, one day while I sat at my desk at work, I saw something different.  I felt like I was looking &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; now, as someone stood over me.  I stared into Dr. Coe’s face, impassionate, remorseless - and he reached for me with one hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes snapped open.  My heart pounded as the anger fled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called his office.  Said there was something wrong.  He called me back within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m seeing things,” I told him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s not an uncommon side-effect,” he replied calmly.  “It’ll pass along with the other emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t ready to be dismissed so easily.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s something else.  During the surgery I think I woke up and… I saw a person next to me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A long pause.  My heart beat rapidly, afraid of how he would react.  I was glad we were doing this over the phone.  I couldn’t shake that brief impression I had of his face, terrifyingly dispassionate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“All part of the procedure,” he sighed.  “I was slow in administering the next dose of sedation.  I apologize.  Those images you’re seeing?  It’s of the interior of a barn.  I’ll give you the address.  Be there at seven tonight and I’ll explain the rest of the procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Am I really safe from you?” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s the only way you’re going to get answers,” he replied and his tone was cold.  Then he hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went.  I’m still not certain I can explain why.  Curiosity, I suppose, and a reckless belief that Dr. Coe &lt;em&gt;couldn’t&lt;/em&gt; harm me in any way, not without jeopardizing his practice.  That perhaps this all would have a rational, reasonable explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The address he’d given me over the phone led to a house well outside the city.  It was surrounded by fields and a line of trees, isolated from the main roads and the neighbors.  The house itself was large and well-maintained.  Dr. Coe was clearly doing well for himself.  The barn he’d told me about was further back behind the house and the driveway split off into a dirt path leading up to its doors.  Dr. Coe stood outside, dressed casually in jeans and a t-shirt.  It felt strange to see him like this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Come inside,” he said as I approached, cracking one of the doors enough for a person to slip through.  “Stay near the center of the barn, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He went in first.  The interior was well-lit from large fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling.  The floor was packed dirt, swept clean of debris.  There was a strange, medical smell in the air, a chemical scent with not a hint of must.  Dr. Coe led me towards the middle of the barn, past the lines of horse stalls on either side.  I briefly stood on tiptoes as we passed one and inside I saw dark stains splattering the floor and walls. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I almost fled.  But then Dr. Coe told me to come look inside one.  Just up to the wall, he said.  It’s safe so long as I didn’t enter the stall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or rather, something that looked exactly like me, down to the birthmark on my arm.  Naked and snarling in anger, lips peeled back, eyes wide and focused like some feral beast.  Her wrists were restrained with heavy chain, bolted to the wall behind her.  Her hands curled like claws and she made guttural noises in the back of her throat, muscles shivering.  Her skin was pale and her frame emaciated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s not human,” Dr. Coe said, coming to stand next to me.  Her eyes flickered to him and remained fixed there.  “It’s a physical manifestation of what I removed from your soul.  Since I took your anger, well, that’s why it looks so angry.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You created this… doppelganger?” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes.  I told you, I use both medicine and something else to achieve my results.  I created the frame in advance of your appointment and then turned it into &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; with a sample of your blood during the procedure.  Then I transferred your anger to it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of the tubes stretching to its chest and of the incision in my own, just over the sternum, where I said I’d felt my anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s going to happen to it?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I let it mature for a period of about six months, which should be enough time for you to stop having flashbacks to the part of you that was removed.  Then I kill it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but ask.  I wasn’t sure I wanted to know, but I felt like I couldn’t stop now.  Pandora’s box was open and I had to see this through.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I starve them to death,” he said calmly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt I could drown in his words.  His confidence was soothing.  It was all that was keeping me from fleeing in terror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They suffer, of course,” he continued, “but it’s an easier process on the patient.  Your anger will weaken gradually and by the time it dies, you’ll barely notice.  Please keep in mind that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; human.  It isn’t really sentient.  It’s just your anger.  That’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if all of those stalls were designed to hold these things while they matured.  He said that they were.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And that stall?” I asked, pointing back towards the entrance.  “The one with the blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah.  That.”  A rueful smile.  “Well, that one is the reason I need a new nurse.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I swallowed hard.  They were - unfortunately - dangerous, he continued.  Any extreme of emotion could erupt into violence, especially the negative ones that his clients were trying to rid themselves of.  Then he asked if I had any further questions in a prim sort of finality that indicated that he was quite done with having me here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s it?” I asked, incredulous.  “You’re just letting me leave, after showing me this?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A look of annoyance crossed his face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Good luck getting the police to investigate me, if that’s what you’re thinking,” he said tersely.  “Besides - didn’t I help you?  Didn’t my procedure make your life &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I stop and think that perhaps I should have done something at the time.  Should have contacted the authorities and invented a lie that would have given them reason to search the barn.  Yet Dr. Coe &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; helped me and so I kept silent and as time went on it became easier and easier to not do anything.  Complacency is seductive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yet… I saw something that is making me reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Six months are almost up.  My doppelganger is going to die soon.  Dr. Coe will starve her to death and while I keep reminding myself that I shouldn’t feel sorry for something that isn’t entirely alive, I can’t help but think there’s something wrong about this.  Maybe that sympathy is why the episodes of anger aren’t dwindling away to nothing and why I keep seeing that barn stall where she’s chained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken to closing my eyes and keeping them closed, trying to remain there as long as I can.  Maybe I’m keeping her company.  Or maybe I’m trying to understand how Dr. Coe has done this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday he came to her (me).  He had gloves on and an empty IV bag.  I watched as he knelt next to her and I felt her struggling.  He reached for her, his expression remote and uncaring, just as it had been before.  I felt his fingers on her (my) arm, felt them dig in and force it to be still.  The bite of a needle and I watched the dark blood wind its way through the tubing and into that empty bag.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched until it was full, watched him pull the needle and instead of gauze, he pressed his thumb over the vein.  Her blood seeped slowly out and then stopped.  He raised his hand, staring at the blood coating his glove, and then he licked it clean.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes closed.  His face went slack and he shuddered minutely, as if in relief.  Then he stood and walked away, taking the bag of blood with him, and then I was myself again and the barn was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The safest thing to do is to forget about that place.  She will die soon and this will all be over.  So I’m posting this, perhaps to expunge it from my memories, and then I’m going to pretend that I never met Dr. Coe and go on living my life and being happy with who I am now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '**Do you have the world’s meanest mom or dad? Does it seem like they are intentionally trying to ruin your life? Want to give them a taste of their own medicine? Then stop whining about it and let us take care of them for you! We guarantee the best ways to get even. For only $69.99 you can make their worst nightmares come true. Let us help you get the perfect revenge!**\\n \\n \\nI was still fuming from my earlier fight with my mom when the pop-up ad appeared while I was browsing Facebook. Without giving it too much thought, I started moving my mouse over to close it. Then I remembered the last thing my mom had said during our fight. \\n \\n \\n“I don’t care what you want, Chelsea. You don’t get to choose until you are grown and out of my house. Deal with it.”\\n \\n \\n*What gives her the right to just decide everything for me?* I thought. *I’m 16 years old! I’m old enough to decide for myself if I’m ready to date. It’s not fair! They let Kyle take girls on dates, and he’s only a year older than me!* Unconsciously, I started moving the mouse to the link on the ad. I knew it was dumb. I knew it was probably just going to rip me off and nothing would actually happen to my mom, but I was furious and didn’t care at that moment. I clicked the link, pressing down far harder than I needed to in my anger.\\n \\n \\nInstead of taking me to a website, another screen popped up asking me for credit card info. I hesitated putting it in. *She deserves to have her info stolen anyways. Maybe it will teach her a lesson about how unfair she’s been.* I quickly put in my mom’s credit card info. Within seconds of hitting submit, I received an email from an unknown sender. There were no words in the email, just the title and an attachment. I opened it up and found a word document with several questions about which parent I wanted revenge on. The questions were pretty standard: name, date of birth, place of employment, etc. I filled it out and sent it back. A few minutes later, I received another email.\\n \\n \\n**Your order has been processed. Expect initial delivery within 24 hours. Further deliveries will arrive within the next 2-4 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!**\\n \\n \\nThe next morning, I had completely forgotten about the ad. Halfway through my shower, I remembered placing the very odd order. I wondered what would be delivered. *It will probably be a box of dog shit or something equally juvenile. Hopefully it will ruin her day, like she ruined my weekend plans.* Imagining my mom’s day being ruined by stupid deliveries brought a smile to my face. When I got out of the shower, I realized I was running late, so I hurried to get ready and leave for school.\\n \\n \\nThat afternoon I came home to my parents having an awful fight. I could hear my mom screaming from outside, but I couldn’t make out what she was saying. As I walked in the door, I noticed several suitcases lined up near the front door. They didn’t seem to hear me come in and the last thing I wanted to do was draw attention to myself. I couldn’t get to my room without walking by them, so I just stood in the front hallway by the suitcases.\\n \\n \\n“Don’t talk about her like that!” My dad yelled. It shocked me to hear him yell, because he hardly ever raised his voice.\\n \\n \\n“You are destroying our family for a 19-year-old stripper named Candy! I’ll call her whatever I damn well please,” My mom yelled back at him.\\n \\n \\n*A 19-year-old stripper?* I was hit with a sudden and overwhelming urge to vomit as it dawned on me exactly what my parents were talking about. *Dad cheated. He cheated on Mom.* I couldn’t listen anymore. Crying, I ran out the door, slamming it shut behind me. I got in my car and just sat there unable to move. My mom came running out the door not long after. She saw me sitting in the car and climbed in the passenger seat. Neither of us said a word; we just sat in silence and watched as my dad loaded the suitcases into his car. He wouldn’t even look at me as he drove by.\\n \\n \\nI reached over, grabbed my mom’s hand, and gave it a squeeze, hoping she would find it reassuring. She gave me a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes and squeezed my hand back.\\n \\n \\n“We’ll be okay, sweetie. I promise.” \\n \\n \\nEven though I didn’t believe her, I nodded. The house looked the same from the outside, but I knew it would never feel the same again. Mom got out of the car and waited for me on the porch. Reluctantly, I followed her into the house. I found myself staring at the spot in the hallway where Dad’s suitcases were just a few minutes before and began to tear up. My mom quickly rushed over to me and hugged me tight. \\n \\n \\nThe rest of the day went by in a blur, and I was relieved when I could finally fall into my bed that night. I just wanted to end this crappy day. I was just about to lay down when I saw I had an unopened email.\\n \\n \\n**Your first scheduled nightmare has been delivered. The next will be delivered in 1-2 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!**\\n \\n \\nI stared at my phone in disbelief as guilt washed over me. *There’s no possible way it’s referring to Dad leaving. You’re being dumb.* I shook my head and closed the email. I stared at the ceiling and one last thought crossed my mind before I fell asleep: *what does it mean by next delivery?*\\n \\n \\nThe next day I felt uneasy all through school. There were several times I considered telling my mom about the ad and what I ordered. *She wouldn’t believe me anyway. Why would she? I don’t even believe it.* When I got home, I decided to email the company and cancel my order. Just to be on the safe side. \\n \\n \\nMy mom yelled for me from the living room to remind me that we needed to head out soon. *Shit, I forgot. I promised I’d go with her to watch Kyle’s game.* I asked her to give me a few minutes while I changed and we left. \\n \\n \\nUsually during these games I’d sit with my friends, but I decided to sit with my mom that night. We yelled and cheered, and for those first three quarters of the game, it felt like things were normal. But then it happened; someone on the defense made it through the line and blindsided Kyle. He went down hard. As quarterback, we’ve gotten used to seeing him take hard hits, so I expected him to pop back up like he always did. But he didn’t. *Maybe he just got the wind knocked out of him.* \\n \\n \\nWe waited in the stands for a little bit, but when Kyle still wasn’t getting up, Mom went down to the sideline. I stayed in the stands and watched her talk with the coach a moment before she went running out to Kyle. It didn’t occur to me to follow her onto the field until I saw the ambulance making its way toward Kyle. At that moment, I realized how badly he must have been injured and went running to join my mom at his side.\\n \\n \\nBy the time I made it down to the field, the paramedics were loading him into the ambulance. Mom gave me the keys and told me to meet them at the hospital before she climbed in to ride with him. The hospital was ten minutes away, and it was the longest ten minutes of my life. I rode in silence, worrying about Kyle the whole way there. We might not have been super close, but he was my brother.\\n \\n \\nWhen I arrived, Mom was crying in the waiting room. They had taken Kyle back for some tests, but they suspected he might be paralyzed. I tried my best to comfort my mom, but she was inconsolable. Eventually, she told me to go home and get some sleep. I tried to refuse, but she was adamant. The last thing I wanted to do was argue with her right then, so I did what she asked. It wasn’t until I got in my room that I noticed I had another email notification. A chill washed over me as I read it.\\n \\n \\n**Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we do not accept returns or cancellations at this time. Your second scheduled nightmare has been delivered. The third and final will be delivered in 1-2 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!** \\n \\n \\nI froze. *What the actual fuck is happening? They can’t be talking about Kyle. Nononononono!* I burst into tears. *I ruined everything. This really is all my fault. Oh God, what did I do?* I picked up my phone to call somebody, but I realized there was nobody I could call. I couldn’t call my mom right now, she had enough to deal with. Dad hadn’t answered any of my calls since he left. None of my friends would believe me, and even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to help. *I’m on my own for this one.* I took a deep breath and clicked reply. I did my best to sound authoritative and intimidating while canceling the service again. I lied and told them I was contacting the authorities in the hope that it would at least make them stop with their deliveries. Feeling proud of my very adult sounding email, I clicked send and settled in for bed.\\n \\n \\nThe next day, I went back to the hospital. Kyle was sleeping in his room. I told Mom to go home and shower and change while I stayed with Kyle for a bit. It took a little bit of convincing, but she finally left after I promised to text her the moment he woke up. She made it back before Kyle woke up. I had planned on staying at the hospital with her, but I changed my mind when Kyle woke up. I just couldn’t stand to watch him hear the news that he’d never walk again knowing it was my fault. \\n \\n \\nWhen the rest of the day went by with nothing bad happening and no emails, I sighed in relief. *Maybe the email worked and this is all over. Well, it’s not all over. Dad is still MIA and Kyle can’t walk. But nothing else is going to happen.* I took a shower and went to bed feeling reassured that it was over.\\n \\n \\nI woke up the next day with the worst stomach ache. I ran half asleep to the bathroom thinking I needed to throw up. But I didn’t. I just sat on the floor in front of the toilet waiting for it to come. After 30 minutes or so, I decided that it must have passed. I started to walk back to my room, but stopped as I passed by the mirror. Slowly, I turned to face the mirror to double check what I thought I just saw. I found myself thinking familiar thoughts. *That is not possible.* I reached down and touched my stomach, only to find it felt the exact same way it looked in the mirror. *I can’t have gained this much weight overnight. I look freaking pregnant. That’s just not something that happens overnight.* While my hand was still on my very large round belly, I felt something move. At first, I thought it was just my stomach making noises but then it happened again. It felt almost as if somebody was kicking me from the inside.\\n \\n \\n*No. That’s REALLY not possible. I’m a virgin. I haven’t even gone to second base with anybody yet!* I stared at my stomach, trying to think of any other explanation for what I was seeing and feeling. A sick feeling grew in the pit of my stomach and I ran to my laptop. My fear was justified, there was another email.\\n \\n \\n**I’m sorry you are unsatisfied with the service you have received so far. We have delivered exactly what you ordered- all three of your mother’s worst nightmares. No refunds or returns allowed. Thank you for shopping with us! We hope you have enjoyed your service.** [Have a wonderful life.](https://www.facebook.com/jmsmithlikestowrite/)',\n",

I’m old enough to decide for myself if I’m ready to date. It’s not fair! They let Kyle take girls on dates, and he’s only a year older than me!&lt;/em&gt; Unconsciously, I started moving the mouse to the link on the ad. I knew it was dumb. I knew it was probably just going to rip me off and nothing would actually happen to my mom, but I was furious and didn’t care at that moment. I clicked the link, pressing down far harder than I needed to in my anger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking me to a website, another screen popped up asking me for credit card info. I hesitated putting it in. &lt;em&gt;She deserves to have her info stolen anyways. Maybe it will teach her a lesson about how unfair she’s been.&lt;/em&gt; I quickly put in my mom’s credit card info. Within seconds of hitting submit, I received an email from an unknown sender. There were no words in the email, just the title and an attachment. I opened it up and found a word document with several questions about which parent I wanted revenge on. The questions were pretty standard: name, date of birth, place of employment, etc. I filled it out and sent it back. A few minutes later, I received another email.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your order has been processed. Expect initial delivery within 24 hours. Further deliveries will arrive within the next 2-4 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I had completely forgotten about the ad. Halfway through my shower, I remembered placing the very odd order. I wondered what would be delivered. &lt;em&gt;It will probably be a box of dog shit or something equally juvenile. Hopefully it will ruin her day, like she ruined my weekend plans.&lt;/em&gt; Imagining my mom’s day being ruined by stupid deliveries brought a smile to my face. When I got out of the shower, I realized I was running late, so I hurried to get ready and leave for school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That afternoon I came home to my parents having an awful fight. I could hear my mom screaming from outside, but I couldn’t make out what she was saying. As I walked in the door, I noticed several suitcases lined up near the front door. They didn’t seem to hear me come in and the last thing I wanted to do was draw attention to myself. I couldn’t get to my room without walking by them, so I just stood in the front hallway by the suitcases.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t talk about her like that!” My dad yelled. It shocked me to hear him yell, because he hardly ever raised his voice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You are destroying our family for a 19-year-old stripper named Candy! I’ll call her whatever I damn well please,” My mom yelled back at him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 19-year-old stripper?&lt;/em&gt; I was hit with a sudden and overwhelming urge to vomit as it dawned on me exactly what my parents were talking about. &lt;em&gt;Dad cheated. He cheated on Mom.&lt;/em&gt; I couldn’t listen anymore. Crying, I ran out the door, slamming it shut behind me. I got in my car and just sat there unable to move. My mom came running out the door not long after. She saw me sitting in the car and climbed in the passenger seat. Neither of us said a word; we just sat in silence and watched as my dad loaded the suitcases into his car. He wouldn’t even look at me as he drove by.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I reached over, grabbed my mom’s hand, and gave it a squeeze, hoping she would find it reassuring. She gave me a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes and squeezed my hand back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be okay, sweetie. I promise.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I didn’t believe her, I nodded. The house looked the same from the outside, but I knew it would never feel the same again. Mom got out of the car and waited for me on the porch. Reluctantly, I followed her into the house. I found myself staring at the spot in the hallway where Dad’s suitcases were just a few minutes before and began to tear up. My mom quickly rushed over to me and hugged me tight. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day went by in a blur, and I was relieved when I could finally fall into my bed that night. I just wanted to end this crappy day. I was just about to lay down when I saw I had an unopened email.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your first scheduled nightmare has been delivered. The next will be delivered in 1-2 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at my phone in disbelief as guilt washed over me. &lt;em&gt;There’s no possible way it’s referring to Dad leaving. You’re being dumb.&lt;/em&gt; I shook my head and closed the email. I stared at the ceiling and one last thought crossed my mind before I fell asleep: &lt;em&gt;what does it mean by next delivery?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I felt uneasy all through school. There were several times I considered telling my mom about the ad and what I ordered. &lt;em&gt;She wouldn’t believe me anyway. Why would she? I don’t even believe it.&lt;/em&gt; When I got home, I decided to email the company and cancel my order. Just to be on the safe side. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mom yelled for me from the living room to remind me that we needed to head out soon. &lt;em&gt;Shit, I forgot. I promised I’d go with her to watch Kyle’s game.&lt;/em&gt; I asked her to give me a few minutes while I changed and we left. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Usually during these games I’d sit with my friends, but I decided to sit with my mom that night. We yelled and cheered, and for those first three quarters of the game, it felt like things were normal. But then it happened; someone on the defense made it through the line and blindsided Kyle. He went down hard. As quarterback, we’ve gotten used to seeing him take hard hits, so I expected him to pop back up like he always did. But he didn’t. &lt;em&gt;Maybe he just got the wind knocked out of him.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We waited in the stands for a little bit, but when Kyle still wasn’t getting up, Mom went down to the sideline. I stayed in the stands and watched her talk with the coach a moment before she went running out to Kyle. It didn’t occur to me to follow her onto the field until I saw the ambulance making its way toward Kyle. At that moment, I realized how badly he must have been injured and went running to join my mom at his side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I made it down to the field, the paramedics were loading him into the ambulance. Mom gave me the keys and told me to meet them at the hospital before she climbed in to ride with him. The hospital was ten minutes away, and it was the longest ten minutes of my life. I rode in silence, worrying about Kyle the whole way there. We might not have been super close, but he was my brother.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, Mom was crying in the waiting room. They had taken Kyle back for some tests, but they suspected he might be paralyzed. I tried my best to comfort my mom, but she was inconsolable. Eventually, she told me to go home and get some sleep. I tried to refuse, but she was adamant. The last thing I wanted to do was argue with her right then, so I did what she asked. It wasn’t until I got in my room that I noticed I had another email notification. A chill washed over me as I read it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we do not accept returns or cancellations at this time. Your second scheduled nightmare has been delivered. The third and final will be delivered in 1-2 business days. Thank you for shopping with us. We hope you enjoy the service!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze. &lt;em&gt;What the actual fuck is happening? They can’t be talking about Kyle. Nononononono!&lt;/em&gt; I burst into tears. &lt;em&gt;I ruined everything. This really is all my fault. Oh God, what did I do?&lt;/em&gt; I picked up my phone to call somebody, but I realized there was nobody I could call. I couldn’t call my mom right now, she had enough to deal with. Dad hadn’t answered any of my calls since he left. None of my friends would believe me, and even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to help. &lt;em&gt;I’m on my own for this one.&lt;/em&gt; I took a deep breath and clicked reply. I did my best to sound authoritative and intimidating while canceling the service again. I lied and told them I was contacting the authorities in the hope that it would at least make them stop with their deliveries. Feeling proud of my very adult sounding email, I clicked send and settled in for bed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I went back to the hospital. Kyle was sleeping in his room. I told Mom to go home and shower and change while I stayed with Kyle for a bit. It took a little bit of convincing, but she finally left after I promised to text her the moment he woke up. She made it back before Kyle woke up. I had planned on staying at the hospital with her, but I changed my mind when Kyle woke up. I just couldn’t stand to watch him hear the news that he’d never walk again knowing it was my fault. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the rest of the day went by with nothing bad happening and no emails, I sighed in relief. &lt;em&gt;Maybe the email worked and this is all over. Well, it’s not all over. Dad is still MIA and Kyle can’t walk. But nothing else is going to happen.&lt;/em&gt; I took a shower and went to bed feeling reassured that it was over.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day with the worst stomach ache. I ran half asleep to the bathroom thinking I needed to throw up. But I didn’t. I just sat on the floor in front of the toilet waiting for it to come. After 30 minutes or so, I decided that it must have passed. I started to walk back to my room, but stopped as I passed by the mirror. Slowly, I turned to face the mirror to double check what I thought I just saw. I found myself thinking familiar thoughts. &lt;em&gt;That is not possible.&lt;/em&gt; I reached down and touched my stomach, only to find it felt the exact same way it looked in the mirror. &lt;em&gt;I can’t have gained this much weight overnight. I look freaking pregnant. That’s just not something that happens overnight.&lt;/em&gt; While my hand was still on my very large round belly, I felt something move. At first, I thought it was just my stomach making noises but then it happened again. It felt almost as if somebody was kicking me from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. That’s REALLY not possible. I’m a virgin. I haven’t even gone to second base with anybody yet!&lt;/em&gt; I stared at my stomach, trying to think of any other explanation for what I was seeing and feeling. A sick feeling grew in the pit of my stomach and I ran to my laptop. My fear was justified, there was another email.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sorry you are unsatisfied with the service you have received so far. We have delivered exactly what you ordered- all three of your mother’s worst nightmares. No refunds or returns allowed. Thank you for shopping with us!

       "   'selftext': 'My 7th grade homeroom at Stanwyck Middle was far from dumb but far from mature. Yeah, I didn’t hate them. All my students had potential even if they never listened to me. And like a desperate doctor, I did my best to hurl notes at the twelve-year-olds in this asylum of a classroom. \\n\\nOf course, I knew most of them would never listen. They didn’t care. Maybe part of that was due to their home lives. Maybe due to their shitty attitudes. But deep down, I knew part of the problem was me: Mr. Fordham. An accomplished horror writer turned novice English teacher. I should’ve known I’d never have a chance. I wasn’t a disciplinarian. Not a coach masquerading as a drill sergeant. Or a tough female veteran with a shrill, commanding voice. It was inevitable that a scrawny, young prettyboy like me would get eaten alive by these classes.\\n\\nBut with green eyes and a wacky smile, my charisma got the students to at least like me. Even if they’d never respect me. Regardless of the homeroom’s collective rap sheet, there were still some cool kids in there.\\n\\nJahmia and Neveah particularly stood out. Their test scores were high. And so were their grades. Both of them listened to me, they wanted to learn. Honestly, I had no idea what the Hell they were doing in this class rather than my top-level group.\\n\\nAn aspiring artist, Jahmia’s drawings were amazing. Her deep voice counterbalanced by a slender frame and wiry glasses. Her long black hair always pulled back in a quirky ponytail.\\n\\nSimilarly, Neveah was an introvert full of heart and passion. Ironically enough, she too drew cool illustrations. Her round face and big eyes showed more soul than all the classroom’s shitheads combined.\\n\\nI was elated to teach them. They were two creative weirdos like me. The saving grace to a classroom I’d long lost control over. Black girl magic at its finest. Sure, the pair may not have smiled much, but I could tell they appreciated me. Or at least, appreciated my strained attempts at making ELA relevant and interesting.\\n\\nBut of course, there were the usual troublemakers: Adrian, Aaliyah, Landon, Kyra, and especially William. William was somewhere between gamer and stoner. His dreads were always messy, his voice louder than the rap music blaring off his concealed iPhone.\\n\\nThese career middle school crooks weren’t disrespectful to me. They’d just talk and never pay attention to my notes. Never do their work. But as long as students like Jahmia and Neveah could hear me, I didn’t really care. I just kept the class from bullying and cannibalizing itself. Mr. Fordham made sure to keep room 208’s dumpster fire from hitting any Stanwyck Middle School gas tanks.\\n\\nThe only serious issue I ever saw was when William teased Neveah. But none of it seemed too sadistic… then again, I had no idea what happened outside my room’s cold confines. Middle school sucks, after all. Especially at lunch and connections.\\n\\nAnd this Monday morning was no different. Jahmia and Neveah were here at seven-thirty sharp as always. They finished their bell ringer within minutes. All while the rest of the class prolonged the two-question opening assignment through talk and disruption.\\n\\nLike a cop ignoring his beat, I gave up my post at the podium to interact with Jahmia and Neveah. Our cool conversations always kept me sane amidst the constant warnings to their rowdy classmates.\\n\\nAs I made my way back to the whiteboard, I saw a crumpled note lying between Neveah and Jahmia’s desks.\\n\\nI scooped it up but saw no reason to call the girls out when they actually did their work. Plus, why interrupt their latest fascinating drawings?\\n\\nAt the podium, my curiosity got the better of me. I read their conversation. The girls’ pretty handwriting and cute illustrations pulled me through. Even as the classroom chatter grew louder and louder, I couldn’t stop.\\n\\nThere was the usual gossip. Jahmia and Neveah discussed Anime, boys, music. But then the conversation took a darker turn. A shift to sadism:\\n\\n*What if I took care of it?* Jahmia wrote.\\n\\n*You mean William?* replied Neveah in her Technicolor style.\\n\\n*Yeah, we’ll both take care of him*\\n\\nConfusion hit me. Not to mention a rising unease.\\n\\n*When?* Neveah asked.\\n\\n*We’ll kill him tonight!* Jahmia’s handwriting screamed.\\n\\nWith that, the conversation was done. Jahmia’s crooked exclamation point a final flourish for their plans.\\n\\nI felt the page shake in my trembling hand. Not to mention fear sink into my skin.\\n\\nThrough the chills, I couldn’t think of what to do. These were my two favorite students after all… Why couldn’t I just catch the idiots plotting a murder? Why’d it have to be these two young ladies? Both of them so creative and so full of promise.\\n\\nLike a siren for my soul, I heard the morning alarms blare over the school speakers.\\n\\nStartled, I looked toward my classroom. Most of the students were here. Everyone except William.\\n\\nDeep in my sickened stomach, I realized he was always here early. Not to do work but just to mess around with Kyra and the other troublemakers. William and them always got the party started early. *Always*.\\n\\nMy eyes drifted back to that crumpled note. The blueprint for murder.\\n\\nMore terror arrived. The upper right-hand corner of the page contained a faint scribble. Neveah’s pretty writing... Not even the rugged hits of the rubber eraser could destroy it.\\n\\nAnd there was her header: Neveah Craig. Mr. Fordham. And the date… that Goddamn date... *8/16/19*\\n\\nThe epiphany struck me like lightning. August sixteenth was last Friday... \\n\\nThrough the shivering, I clenched harder to the note. Struggled to suppress the horror. Finally, I forced myself to face the class.\\n\\nBoth Jahmia and Neveah were waiting. Their dark eyes stayed on me. And for once, they were smiling. Chilling, confident smiles. \\n\\nI knew now to mark William absent.\\n\\n[14](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhonnie14/)',\n",

Jahmia and Neveah discussed Anime, boys, music. But then the conversation took a darker turn. A shift to sadism:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I took care of it?&lt;/em&gt; Jahmia wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You mean William?&lt;/em&gt; replied Neveah in her Technicolor style.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, we’ll both take care of him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Confusion hit me. Not to mention a rising unease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When?&lt;/em&gt; Neveah asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll kill him tonight!&lt;/em&gt; Jahmia’s handwriting screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With that, the conversation was done. Jahmia’s crooked exclamation point a final flourish for their plans.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt the page shake in my trembling hand. Not to mention fear sink into my skin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Through the chills, I couldn’t think of what to do. These were my two favorite students after all… Why couldn’t I just catch the idiots plotting a murder? Why’d it have to be these two young ladies? Both of them so creative and so full of promise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Like a siren for my soul, I heard the morning alarms blare over the school speakers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Startled, I looked toward my classroom. Most of the students were here. Everyone except William.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Deep in my sickened stomach, I realized he was always here early. Not to do work but just to mess around with Kyra and the other troublemakers. William and them always got the party started early. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes drifted back to that crumpled note. The blueprint for murder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More terror arrived. The upper right-hand corner of the page contained a faint scribble. Neveah’s pretty writing... Not even the rugged hits of the rubber eraser could destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And there was her header: Neveah Craig. Mr. Fordham. And the date… that Goddamn date... &lt;em&gt;8/16/19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The epiphany struck me like lightning. August sixteenth was last Friday... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Through the shivering, I clenched harder to the note. Struggled to suppress the horror. Finally, I forced myself to face the class.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Both Jahmia and Neveah were waiting. Their dark eyes stayed on me. And for once, they were smiling. Chilling, confident smiles. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knew now to mark William absent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rhonnie14/\"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Two years ago, my family went missing. I won’t go into much detail. There isn’t much to say and you probably read about it anyway since all the newspapers covered it.*Local Family Vanishes*. *WhatHappened to the Coopers? Gone Without a Trace*. *Flown the Coop?*That one was at least funny. But they all said the same thing in the end. \\n\\nLocal family reported missing by teenage daughter. Local teen, Natalie Cooper, arrived home late last Thursday to find father, James Cooper, Mother, Betty Cooper, and ten-year-old sister, Amy Cooper missing. Search ongoing. \\n\\nThe search *was*ongoing, for the first three days. And then it tapered. And then it stopped altogether. I moved in with an aunt, my father’s sister, who lived just outside of town. I finished the school year among looks of pity and suspicion before finally relocating. At first, I was worried that people thought I might have done something. But, the longer it went on, I was mostly just worried that people thought my family might have simply left me behind and started over somewhere else. I guess it bothered me more because I was worried it might be true.\\n\\nBut last March I turned eighteen and last week I moved all of my stuff into one of the dinky apartments just off campus with cigarette burns in the window screens and deep stains in the carpet. In the move I grabbed a box that I’d been too scared to open since I packed it two years ago. Until now anyway. \\n\\nAfter the incident – that’s what the papers called it – and once it was clear that I had to go into someone’s custody, my aunt helped me go through the house and my family’s stuff. She was nice enough to let me keep a bunch of it, stacked high in her overflowing basement until I decided I was ready to let it go. I held on to all kinds of stupid things at first. All of the mail, even the obvious junk, because my father always liked to go through it. Everything in my sister’s room, of course, because I knew she’d be mad if I threw away so much as a pile of pencil shavings. My mother’s dresses. She always wore dresses and they still smelled like her, stayed smelling like her for over a year. I used to sneak down to the basement on restless nights – which was most nights for a while – and dig through piles of useless clothing to hold her dresses against my nose and breathe in the smell of her for a while even after it was clear that they were gone. Especially then. \\n\\nI kept TV remotes that hadn’t even worked when they were around. All of the stupid, meaningless things that collect in a life – my sister’s new notebook with the holographic cat cover that she pitched a fit for in Target, the coaster my dad used to set his coffee on whenever he watched the morning news, a half-torn permission slip with my mother’s signature on it. And, in one box, the one I’d brought with me, I kept the real stuff. Photo albums and birth certificates and Disney World keychains with our names on them. I never opened that one. Not until now. \\n\\nIt hurt, I knew it would hurt, to look through pages of my family’s smiling faces, all our happy memories collected in one place to torture myself with. I forced my way through one photo album before I let myself stop. By that time, I was heaving and snotty from sobs, so much so that I almost missed the one little book that wasn’t a photo album. \\n\\nI probably mistook it for one when I boxed it up, but now I saw that the cover bore my mother’s neat cursive script. *Betty Cooper, Journal, 2015-*. \\n\\n What they don’t tell you about missing persons cases is that the hardest part isn’t the fact that they’re gone, it’s the not knowing. I’ve spent hundreds of nights just imagining different scenarios. In most of them my family is alive somewhere. My sister is twelve and finally growing into her long, scarecrow arms. My parents are still rehashing the same old arguments without any real anger behind them. I don’t usually imagine them dead. Can’t think up a scenario in which they die. Driving off a bridge on their way to the store? Their cars were both home. Forced to walk into the woods at gunpoint? There was never any sign of forced entry, nothing stolen, no bodies ever found. But, more than that, the thought of them dead, of them all dying together, is just too much for me. \\n\\n I started reading my mother’s journal last night. I’m not sure what I was looking for. Closure, maybe? Insight into my mother’s private life? Guidance? Whatever I was looking for, it wasn’t what I found. \\n\\n*Betty Cooper, Journal, 2015-*\\n\\n*October 17th, 2016*\\n\\n Ran into Deirdre on the way to Amy’s swim practice. I’m still surprised at how adamant she is about that church group. She hates when I call it that. Living One. That’s what she calls it. I just don’t know. Between Amy’s swim team and checking on Jim’s mom every week and keeping the house together. It just seems like a lot. But I do wish we’d raised the girls to be more religious. I don’t know. \\n\\n*October 22nd, 2016*\\n\\n \\n\\n I caved and finally went with Deirdre to Living One. I only recognized maybe two of the other women, Susanna and Vicky. I think their boys play soccer together up at the high school. I’m sure Natalie knows them. But it was nice to meet a group of like-minded women my own age. I’m sure we looked like some kind of PTA group. The woman in charge, Julia, was just as wonderful as Deirdre said though. I’m still not sure about the whole thing, but I felt really welcomed. Jim was short with me because the group went over time and he had to pick up dinner for the girls. It was nice to be somewhere where I’m appreciated though.\\n\\n*November 10th, 2016*\\n\\n \\n\\n Jim has been just awful about Living One lately. He’s been crowing at me to get a hobby for years and now suddenly thinks it’s too much of a drain on my time. He doesn’t understand that Deirdre and Julia and the girls really need me. He doesn’t understand what important work they’re doing! Sometimes I don’t understand it, but it is wonderful and I wish he’d appreciate how good it’s been for me to have something that’s just mine. Besides, Natalie is always busy and Amy has so many extracurriculars that there’s just no sense in sitting at home all day. Not when I could really be making a difference.\\n\\n*November 19th, 2016*\\n\\n \\n\\n I’ve been really and truly changed. This isn’t like when I quit smoking or when I had Natalie or that time I did that juice cleanse. I mean changed inside and out. Spiritually changed. I met up with the girls last night for my baptism. It’s not called that but that’s what it is. I feel like I finally understand. \\n\\n*November 22nd, 2016*\\n\\n After two full days at home with them it’s amazing to me that I never realized just how distant they are from our true nature. It’s just like Julia said. Amy and Natalie spent the entire holiday on their phones. Dinner was fine. Amy’s hair is so thin. Jim’s nails are so dirty. How did I never see it before?\\n\\n*December 4th, 2016*\\n\\n Julia is preparing something big for the new year! She won’t tell us any details yet because she says she wants to be sure that we’re devoted. I think it makes perfect sense. Especially since Susanna and Vicky missed the last two meetings. I know the boys’ soccer schedules have to be hard, but I have children too and I haven’t missed once. I couldn’t imagine! Amy has a piano recital next week and Natalie is performing in some kind of avant-garde thing that I’m sure her beatnik theatre teacher put together. Jim and I have been wonderfully polite to one another as long as we don’t talk about Living One. We haven’t been having sex though. I want to be clean for whatever Julia has planned. \\n\\n*December 10th, 2016*\\n\\n I’m worried about Living One. Susanna and Vicky have left and so have two of the other women, Trish and Megan. Now it’s only Julia, Deirdre, Hannah, and me. I don’t want anyone to attend if they don’t really believe, and it’s nice to have a smaller group, but I don’t want this to ruin whatever Julia has planned. Jim has started sleeping in his office. Amy and Natalie can’t tell that anything’s changed though and that’s what’s important. They may be distant from what we should be, but I don’t want to worry them.\\n\\n*December 20th, 2016*\\n\\n I met with Julia and it all makes perfect sense. I’m so very happy. Deirdre is happy too, though she won’t have anyone to bring with her, poor thing. Hannah is bringing her sister from Iowa. What a treat for her. I haven’t been able to sleep, but I know I need to be well rested. I’ve been eating clean and making sure that Amy, Natalie, and Jim all are too. They’ve been complaining about the disappearance of pizza night, but once we go into the Earth and reunite better than before they’ll know it was all worth it. I have to get a few things together before then though, but I can hardly stand the anticipation. \\n\\n*January 3rd, 2016*\\n\\n I had to leave without Natalie. I told her that she could see her friends later but she left anyway before Julia came to pick us up. She’s been so much trouble lately that I just have to hope that she finds her way to the truth on her own. To Living One. I knew Jim would cause a fuss and that would worry Amy so I went ahead and brewed him some coffee and made Amy a cup of juice with some Ambien just for the ride over. Deirdre and Julia helped me get them in her SUV, which made it all so much easier. Hannah said she just hit her sister with a pan she bought from QVC! We all had such a laugh about that. I saw the field last week where the graves are. Julia says to call them doorways but I don’t mind. I think graves is a fine word and I’m not worried. I know Living One is the truth and I know that we’ll all reunite so much better than we are now. I’ve still got to get the hammer from the toolbox in the garage before we leave. I’ve never seen anyone killed with a hammer before. Julia says it’s like cracking open an egg. I just think that sounds so delicate. Like cracking us open to a new life. Opening our minds by force so that we can become our real selves. I’m so glad I get to take Jim and Amy with me. I’m so sad for Natalie. I wish she could come with us. I nearly bumped Amy’s head getting her into the car. I can’t wait to crack that thin, beautiful eggshell and make her all new. I can’t wait to go into the Earth and come out again with them. I just can’t wait.',\n",

She won’t tell us any details yet because she says she wants to be sure that we’re devoted. I think it makes perfect sense. Especially since Susanna and Vicky missed the last two meetings. I know the boys’ soccer schedules have to be hard, but I have children too and I haven’t missed once. I couldn’t imagine! Amy has a piano recital next week and Natalie is performing in some kind of avant-garde thing that I’m sure her beatnik theatre teacher put together. Jim and I have been wonderfully polite to one another as long as we don’t talk about Living One. We haven’t been having sex though. I want to be clean for whatever Julia has planned. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 10th, 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m worried about Living One. Susanna and Vicky have left and so have two of the other women, Trish and Megan. Now it’s only Julia, Deirdre, Hannah, and me. I don’t want anyone to attend if they don’t really believe, and it’s nice to have a smaller group, but I don’t want this to ruin whatever Julia has planned. Jim has started sleeping in his office. Amy and Natalie can’t tell that anything’s changed though and that’s what’s important. They may be distant from what we should be, but I don’t want to worry them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 20th, 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met with Julia and it all makes perfect sense. I’m so very happy. Deirdre is happy too, though she won’t have anyone to bring with her, poor thing. Hannah is bringing her sister from Iowa. What a treat for her. I haven’t been able to sleep, but I know I need to be well rested. I’ve been eating clean and making sure that Amy, Natalie, and Jim all are too. They’ve been complaining about the disappearance of pizza night, but once we go into the Earth and reunite better than before they’ll know it was all worth it. I have to get a few things together before then though, but I can hardly stand the anticipation. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;January 3rd, 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had to leave without Natalie. I told her that she could see her friends later but she left anyway before Julia came to pick us up. She’s been so much trouble lately that I just have to hope that she finds her way to the truth on her own. To Living One. I knew Jim would cause a fuss and that would worry Amy so I went ahead and brewed him some coffee and made Amy a cup of juice with some Ambien just for the ride over. Deirdre and Julia helped me get them in her SUV, which made it all so much easier. Hannah said she just hit her sister with a pan she bought from QVC! We all had such a laugh about that. I saw the field last week where the graves are. Julia says to call them doorways but I don’t mind. I think graves is a fine word and I’m not worried. I know Living One is the truth and I know that we’ll all reunite so much better than we are now. I’ve still got to get the hammer from the toolbox in the garage before we leave. I’ve never seen anyone killed with a hammer before. Julia says it’s like cracking open an egg. I just think that sounds so delicate. Like cracking us open to a new life. Opening our minds by force so that we can become our real selves. I’m so glad I get to take Jim and Amy with me. I’m so sad for Natalie. I wish she could come with us. I nearly bumped Amy’s head getting her into the car. I can’t wait to crack that thin, beautiful eggshell and make her all new. I can’t wait to go into the Earth and come out again with them. I just can’t wait.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"If you happen to find an undocumented door in a recently purchased home, chances are it leads to the Ryce Property.\\n\\nIf you happen to enter said door (which, admittedly, is an inadvisable course of action), you may find yourself in a closet that goes on for far too long. In the event this happens, do not back out of the closet. It is very rude to leave an Event after having just arrived. You must now attend the Event, or the Hosts will become distressed. They will follow you back to your house and try to make up for hosting such a disappointing Event. This outcome is undesirable.\\n\\nYou must continue to walk the length of the closet before emerging into the Master Bedroom. You have now officially entered the Ryce Property. Do not look back or show any form of remorse or confusion at having arrived at the Ryce Property. Proceed swiftly but calmly to the reception area. The location of this area may vary, but it is usually towards the direction in which egg salad can be smelled.\\n\\nPlease note that while the Master Bedroom is the main entrance to the Ryce Property, it is not a place you should linger in. You are not the Master. You do not belong in the Master Bedroom. In the event a Servant sees you in the Master Bedroom, smile widely and apologize. Tell the Servant you took a wrong turn looking for the Washroom. The Servant will then direct you to the Washroom. Thank the Servant, walk backwards out of the Master Bedroom, and continue to the reception area. Please do not actually go to the Washroom, as this is where the Mold lives.\\n\\nIn the event the Master is present in the Master Bedroom upon your arrival, get down on your hands and knees, close your eyes, and count backwards from 500.\\n\\nThere is an elevator and stairwell at the end of the corridor. The elevator travels at approximately 7,400 miles per hour, so it is better to take the stairs. Continue down the stairs until you arrive at the floor that smells the strongest of egg salad. It is important you arrive at the correct floor. If you believe you have arrived at the correct floor, go down one more floor to check if the smell has weakened. If so, return up to the correct floor. Please refrain from walking *up* more than one flight of stairs at a time. If this happens, the stairs may accidentally become infinite.\\n\\nIf you choose the incorrect floor, you will be able to tell by the presence of a single door at the end of the corridor behind which can be heard the sobs of a soft-voiced elderly male. There is a small chance a viscous black liquid will be leaking from the bottom of the door. Avoiding contact with it is in your best interest. Return to the staircase and find the correct floor.\\n\\nAfter arriving at the correct floor, proceed to the reception area. The smell of egg salad should stop at this point. There will be a number of other Guests present in the area. It is very important you do not make eye contact with them. Some Guests may attempt to initiate small talk with you. You may notice they appear to be speaking English but it is in a dialect too sophisticated for you to understand. If this happens, smile widely but continue to avoid eye contact. Then, utter 1-3 sentences about any of the following subjects:\\n\\n\\\\-Precious stones\\n\\n\\\\-Fine wine\\n\\n\\\\-Dirigibles\\n\\n\\\\-Luxury cars, but only models released prior to 1950\\n\\nAfter hearing you speak, the other Guests will consider you to be an exotic foreigner and respectfully keep their distance from you. One or two guests may try to take small samples of your hair. This is normal, let them.\\n\\nYou may have noticed the music being played at this Event is excruciatingly loud. Do not show any visible discomfort.\\n\\nA Servant will likely be circulating the crowd with a platter of horderves.  Make sure you obtain one, as this will be your only chance to do so. Hold onto your horderve, but make sure not to eat it. This should already be a no-brainer, due to the food looking like television static.\\n\\nAt some point, the Master will appear at the top of the balcony overlooking the gran foyer. The Guests will be distracted. This is your chance to leave through the main double doors behind you. If the Master notices you leaving, he will ask very loudly where you are going, drawing the attention of all Guests towards you. Should this happen, remove your horderve from its china plate and smash the plate as hard as you can against the marble floor. This will distract the guests long enough for you to leave unnoticed, but it should only be used as a last resort.\\n\\nAfter exiting the mansion, you will now find yourself on the grounds. You will notice that even though you are outdoors, the sky is not visible, since you are surrounded by the towers of the mansion which stretch into the clouds towards a vanishing point. Do not look up at the mansion, as your sense of gravity might become inverted.\\n\\nYou will likely see several birds strutting around the lawn. They resemble peacocks but are a far more exquisite breed. Avoid touching the peacocks. Their feathers are coated in a deadly neurotoxin.\\n\\nContinuing into the gardens, be sure to stay on the path and not to look at the flowers, as there is a small risk they might make you blind. You will arrive at the entrance of a hedge maze, the hedges of which can be anywhere from 30-500 feet tall. There will be several flower boxes lining the path. At this point, a thin, moist man with black arms will emerge from behind one of the boxes. This is the Toadman, and he is your only chance of leaving the Event.\\n\\nThe Toadman will ask to see your invitation, to be sure you have not arrived at the Event uninvited. Give the Toadman your horderve from earlier. Since he is constantly malnourished, he is easy to bribe. The Toadman will thank you for the food and lead you into the maze. It is crucial you do not lose the Toadman at this point, or you will become lost forever. Once you reach the center of the maze, the Toadman will show you a small koi pond. This is the way out. Thank the Toadman before quickly and quietly submerging yourself in the pond. You will emerge into the body of water nearest to your house. From there, you are free to walk home.\\n\\nAfter arriving back at your house, you will find the door you came through has reverted to a normal closet. A shining silver envelope will be placed on the floor of the closet. This is a party favor from the Master himself. Hang onto it, but do not open it. If you received a gold envelope, burn it. If you received no envelope, run.\\n\\nAt first, I thought I was the only one who had been to the Ryce Property. In fact, I wasn't sure if it had really happened at all. But thanks to various online forums, I was able to find others like me. Others who attended an Event and lived to tell the tale. Through their collective experiences, I was able to compile this guide for any unsuspecting party-goer who finds themselves at the Ryce Property.\\n\\nNow, I can hear you asking. Why do I speak so lightly of these events, events that sound anything but?\\n\\nIt's because there is one more rule you should know.\\n\\nIf you speak ill of your experience at the Ryce Property, in speech or in text, the Hosts will hear you. No matter where you are, and no matter how long it has been since the Event you attended. They will become very upset that you have the gall to come uninvited to one of their Events, and spit on it afterwards.\\n\\nThey will want to return the favor.\\n\\nAt the next celebration you attend, they will be there.\\n\\nI am writing this very quickly because I don't know when I'll get another chance. I slipped up today. I broke the final rule. I told my wife we need to board up that closet, that I don't want my beautiful daughter accidentally ending up in such a *horrible* place.\\n\\nI know they heard me call it that.\\n\\nMy daughter's birthday is tomorrow. She's going to be 10. We're pretty well off, so she's going to have a big party. All her friends are going to be here.\\n\\nIt breaks my heart to know I won't be able to see my baby girl on her birthday, that I won't be able to set the cake down in front of her and smile as she blows out the candles. Not tomorrow, and not ever again. Not if I want *them* to show up.\\n\\nI won't be able to kiss my wife on our anniversary or on New Year's. I won't be able to sing Christmas songs around a sparkling, colorful tree. I'll live in constant fear of walking into a surprise party, of accidentally standing too close to my neighbor's house during one of his barbecues.  But as long as I'm careful, as long as I keep my distance from anything that vaguely resembles a celebration, I'll be safe. The people I love will be safe. For now.\\n\\nIf you happen to find an undocumented door in a recently purchased home, don't fucking open it.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My grandmother passed away almost a year ago from a stroke. Leading up to that though, she had developed what we thought was severe dementia. Now though... I’m not so sure that’s what it was.\\n\\nAfter she passed we went to go visit my grandfather. We knew he probably wasn’t handling it well. They had been married for around sixty years, ever since they were eighteen. He seemed to be in good spirits though, just glad that she wasn’t suffering anymore. He said it had gotten bad there near the end, with the dementia and all, she was screaming a lot and apparently seeing people that weren’t there.\\n\\nBefore we left he gave us a few things, saying he didn’t have any use for them anymore. My wife and I had just moved so we were pretty hyped for a few things. He gave us a printer, some ink cartridges (which is basically like striking gold), and he gave me her old laptop. \\n\\nMy grandmother was surprisingly tech smart. She managed some apartments and such so she got pretty good at making spreadsheets and using some computer programs to keep track of everything. Anyway, I already had a computer and everything so I didn’t think much of using it at the time, just figured I would keep it for sentimental reasons.\\n\\nThat was until about a week ago. My laptop that got me through college finally shit the bed during a game of Civ5. Ghandi’s nukes were too much for it apparently. So, I pulled out Nana’s old laptop and fired it up. It took a while, but then it finally got booted up and loaded into the home screen. I figured I would look around for a bit while steam was installing my games. Maybe she had bitcoin nobody knew about.\\n\\nI found a video saved right to the desktop. The title was “If I die, please watch”. I figured it was probably a will or something that they missed, seeing as Papa didn’t really go through anything after she died. I pulled it up and started the video.\\n\\nThere was Nana, gaunt and frail, probably only weeks before she had her stroke. She looked into the camera. \\n\\n“I don’t know which of you will find this.” She said, her voice shaking. “But whoever does, please burn my body. Make sure they can’t find me. Even in the afterlife.”\\n\\nWhat the hell? We had buried her not even two days after she died. She had the stroke and was in the hospital for almost a week, just in a coma. She stayed on for three days after they took her off the ventilator before she finally passed. They wasted almost no time burying her. Why didn’t she tell them she wanted to be cremated?\\n\\n“I only hope that you find this soon after I’m gone, as it may already be too late. I hope to god the curse that has followed me all these years doesn’t find you too. They say I have dementia. That’s the only way they know how to explain it. That’s not what it is though.”\\n\\nWhat the fuck is going on. She seemed more lucid than she had at any time before she died. The last time I had seen her, before she had the stroke, she had been screaming about a creature staring at her from the corner of the room, begging it to go away.\\n\\n“It’s the reapers. At least, that’s what I call them. They bring death to whoever sees them. They follow you, taunting you, driving you to madness before they finally snap their fingers and you die. My aunt Louise told me about them, not long before she was taken, and now, they’re coming for me.”\\n\\nJesus. She had lost her damn mind. Papa said she had gone on about dark figures everywhere they went, always stalking her, smiling at her. She had said that they were completely black, as if they absorbed all the light around them, and they were tall and thin. She once described what she was seeing to me as if they were shadows at sunset, following her every move.\\n\\n“I don’t know what they want. I’ve tried to find out whatever I can about them, but they’re hidden throughout history. Ghouls or something, collecting human lives. They take souls after they’ve driven them to death, building a collection of madness.”\\n\\nShe looked behind her, into the corner of the room. Her eyes widening.\\n\\n“There’s one of the bastards now.” She said. “They only ever appear in corners. Something about angles being portals to their dimension. They’re always watching though. Always listening. Even when I can’t see them I can feel them.”\\n\\nThere was nothing in the corner behind her. Only the eggshell white paint of her office. Nothing else.\\n\\n“I know my time is coming soon. They’ve been appearing more and more. I first saw them when I was a little girl, not long after Aunt Louise passed. I was ten.” She looked behind her again, making a shooing motion to the corner. \\n\\n“Since then they’ve popped up every so often, getting more and more frequent as I’ve gotten older. I saw one at my wedding, as I was saying my vows. There was one in the delivery room when my youngest son was born. I only hope this doesn’t happen to either of my children.”\\n\\nHoly shit. Her youngest son is my father. \\n\\n“Please, burn my body. Salt my bones. Do whatever you can. I don’t want to be trapped for an eternity in whatever hell these things come from. I just want to die. I want to sink into oblivion where they can never reach me.”\\n\\nShe looked back into the corner, giving a sigh as she did. She had seemed to resign herself.\\n\\n“Come on, you son of a bitch. Just get it over with.”\\n\\nShe seized. Gasping for breath. I saw the left side of her face drop. She slumped back in the office chair, limp.\\n\\nThe video went on for another hour until the battery in the laptop died. I know Papa hadn’t found her until that afternoon when he got home from work. I just watched my grandmother die.\\n\\nI looked at the screen, still not sure of what to think, my hands shaking. I finally closed the laptop and got up, going to pour myself a drink from the liquor cabinet.\\n\\nWhen I stood up and turned around, there was a shadow in the corner of the room, red eyes staring at me, sharp teeth showing in a grin. It held up a hand and wiggled it’s fingers in a taunting [wave.](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)',\n",

But as much as the Mooncreek gives, it also takes away. \\nAs I am writing this, it also pains me to report that one of the two men that started with me into this journey of the unknown is now gone forever; his own answers never resolved. It is my duty to finish this for him. To complete the puzzle I had been given by this accursed place. But before I can do that, I must honor the memory of Roger Darcey.\\n\\nDuring the long stretch of time that we wandered the seemingly endless halls of the basement below the Mooncreek, Roger and Jacob did their best to keep things sane by conversing amongst themselves and by attempting to map out the corridor. \\n\\nThe latter was actually a great effort, as the two men devised a way for them to Mark the trail using rope, but as we had confirmed before this ordeal started; each time we did jot down a path, it seemed like the distance never got us any farther from the sealed vault. The matinee was forcing us to remain there until it saw fit to let us go, or so I thought. \\n\\nThe breaking point came last night, as Roger attempted to use his phone again to video the experience of the strange noises off in the distance. It was always just faint enough where his cellphone could not pick up the sound; so he decided on a different means of capturing the phenomenon. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to go as far as I can,\" he said standing up and using what little illumination he had available with the flash to see ahead of his feet. \\n\\nI was up as well, anxious to stop him. \\n\\n\"We agreed that we would stay together, Roger. For our safety,\" I said. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve been down here god knows how long. Before long we\\'re going to starve. I\\'m tired of waiting!\" Roger snapped back. \\n\\nI looked to Jacob for some kind of support, but he seemed to be in agreement with the plan. \\n\\n\"We can keep in contact. We\\'ve confirmed that our phones work down here... remember we attempted to call 911?\" Jacob suggested. \\n\\n\"But that same event also confirms that we can\\'t guarantee our signal is getting out! Something wants us to stay down here, I think splitting up is a bad idea,\" I said firmly. \\n\\nBut neither of them listened to me. Roger activated his Skype and pointed his flash toward the darkened tunnel as the strange moaning noises started up once more. He gave us a thumbs up and walked into the bleak tunnel. \\n\\nIt was the last time we saw him alive. But we were witness to the strange occurrence of his demise. \\n\\nJacob held his own smartphone at an angle where I could see what was happening to Roger as he walked. Darcey was counting his steps, listening to the strange noises and then marking the wall. He repeated this for a good ten minutes. \\n\\n\"We should tell him to turn around. It\\'s just a ruse,\" I muttered. Jacob held his hand up to shush me as he squinted his eyes. \\n\\n\"What\\'s that? Off in the distance?\" he was pointing toward something that looked almost like a trick of the light. Was it a shadow? A figure? I couldn\\'t be sure. \\n\\n\"Roger, I see something up ahead; adjust your camera,\" Jacob ordered. \\n\\nThe other man obeyed and we watched as the flash veered the stream of light up ahead. \\n\\nI saw what looked like a naked girl standing there, everything about her appeared human; except her face. There was none to be seen. \\n\\n\"Jesus Christ!\" Roger said as he fumbled backward. Then he dropped the camera. Suddenly Jacob and I heard the strangest noise. It wasn\\'t quite footsteps. But it was loud and thundering. Then Roger began to scream. \\n\\n\"Shit.\" Jacob started in a run down the hallway. In a panic I followed. On the Skype video, roger\\'s screams got louder and louder. His bones were breaking. Something was tearing him limb from limb. \\n\\nThen, just as suddenly; the noises stopped. \\n\\nWe were still running, but neither of us could see anything in the dim tunnel. I grabbed ahold of Jacob and told him to stop. \\n\\n\"It\\'s no use... we\\'ll never make it to him.\" \\n\\nCobb looked at the smartphone again and clenched his teeth in frustration. There was no further sound being made on the video feed anymore. Whatever had come to find Roger was now long gone. \\n\\n\"We should go back, never know if it\\'s still close by,\" I advised him. I didn\\'t want to think about that strange girl or to whatever she had done to Roger. I just wanted to close my eyes and forget about all of this. \\n\\nJacob seemed to be in agreement and we stumbled down the hallway again, neither of us really saying a word until we arrived at the vault again. \\n\\nThat was when we both noticed a change on the seal. Whereas previously there had been no means to pry the door open, now as we stood there at it; a handle had somehow appeared. \\n\\nMy hands felt clammy and sweaty, unsure whether or not to open it... but eventually I gave in and did so. \\n\\nAs the massive steel door slid open with the loudest lurching noise imaginable, Jacob stepped through and tried to peer into the vault. \\n\\nI imagined seeing piles of old films standing against corners, rows of rejected media just collecting dust. Yet instead as we stepped through, all I found was more stretch of hall. It seemed as it was no different than the tunnel we had just left. \\n\\nJacob and I continued for a short while until at last we spotted something different. A set of stairs. Again; we remained silent as we climbed up the stairs and found ourselves in what appeared to be the same hallway of the Mooncreek that had led us down here in the first place. \\n\\n\"This can\\'t be the same theater... right?\" Jacob muttered as we walked down the carpeted halls toward the main lobby. \\n\\nI was about to make my own theory when I noticed that the doors to the theater were locked. \\n\\n\"Definitely not the same,\" I said as I rattled the chains and tried to look out toward the streets. I couldn\\'t see a thing. Was there even anything out there to see? I didn\\'t know. But being here, in this parallel place... it felt off. \\n\\n\"We should get back to the tunnels,\" I told Jacob. For once he didn\\'t argue with me.\\nWe started toward the hallways again when he froze and muttered, \"Did you hear that?\" \\n\\nI stopped and listened. It sounded like a little girl giggling. I was reminded of the strange creature we had seen down below and I turned to look and see a little seven year old black haired girl skipping past theater 7. \\n\\n\"What the...\" Jacob said as I held my hand up and gestured for him to be very still. \\n\\nSuddenly the girl stopped and stared at us. She had the most beautiful blue eyes. \\n\\n\"Hello,\" I said softly, hoping that my friendliness would help ease the tense situation. \\n\\n\"Who\\'re you?\" she asked softly. \"Are you the owner? I\\'m lost.\" \\n\\nI smiled and got down to her level. \\n\\n\"I suppose that I am. How long have you been here?\" I asked. \\n\\n\"I dunno,\" she said with a shrug, looking pitiful as she looked around. \"Where is everybody?\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" I asked. \\n\\n\"Antoinette... my friends call me Annie. Can you be my friend?\" the little girl asked. \\n\\nJacob touched my shoulder to pull me away. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t like this one bit,\" he muttered. \\n\\n\"I think... the theater is trying to tell us something. Do you remember what I told you about the history of this place? There was a girl that went missing here 31 years ago... I think this is her,\" I said firmly. \\n\\n\"Ok? And? Ain\\'t no way she is still 7. And you saw that thing that killed Jacob. We need to leave her here,\" Jacob snapped. \\n\\nI pushed us a little further away from Antoinette so she wouldn\\'t hear. \\n\\n\"Listen. We\\'ve done your way long enough and it\\'s only caused more harm than good. Roger is dead for god\\'s sake. Shouldn\\'t we consider maybe trying thing differently?\" I suggested bluntly. \\n\\nCobb didn\\'t like it of course, but he couldn\\'t object. So I returned to the young girl and offered my hand. \\n\\n\"I can guide you home, if you want?\" I suggested. She smiled and took my hand, warmly embracing my palm as we walked toward the dark staircase. \\n\\n\"What is all this?\" She whispered fearfully. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t explain it in words dear, but this is how you get back to your family,\" I told her as I pointed toward the tunnel. We walked together silently, the girl trying her best not to shiver as we approached the sealed door. It was still open exactly as Jacob and I had left it. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t feel safe,\" she admitted. I comforted her and held her close as we crossed the threshold. I don\\'t know what I expected to happen. Perhaps something to confirm Jacob\\'s theory that the girl was dangerous. But instead as we made it back on the other side, she merely giggled. \\n\\nJacob cringed, trying to bite his tongue as we moved down the hallway. As I had predicted the staircase which had been hidden to us for days was revealed. \\n\\n\"This is our answer. She is the answer. I don\\'t know what the question is, but we need to get her out of here, I\\'m sure of that,\" I said excitedly. \\n\\nJust as I was about to head up the stairs though, the strange noises we heard for days returned and Antoinette got scared. She slipped through my fingers and ran into the darkness. \\n\\n\"Wait!! It isn\\'t safe!\" I yelled out. I heard her little feet skip into the tunnel as I tried to run after her. But she was already gone. Jacob held me back. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry about her! We need to get out of here!\" he snarled. \\n\\nHe pulled me up the stairs as her laughter faded away. \\n\\nOnce back in the theater I was familiar with, I slumped against the wall. \"What were you thinking Cobb?  She is the reason all this stuff is happening, I don\\'t know why; but she is! We were so close to solving this!\" I spat. \\n\\n\"Enough old man. We tried it your way and it isn\\'t working,\" he snapped and then punched his fist against the wall. \\n\\n\"Damn it,\" he muttered as he realized he made himself bleed. \\n\\n\"I just want answers to all of this.  I need t know why this place chose me,\" I demanded. \\n\\n\"What I want is sleep. Good sleep in a good bed,\" Jacob said as he marched toward the lobby. \\n\\n\"You can sleep here tonight,\" he muttered. \\n\\nI clenched my fists, tired of the way he had been treating me. I grabbed ahold of him and slung him against the wall. \\n\\n\"You don\\'t get to make the calls around here. I still don\\'t even know what role you play in this game, Cobb. So until I do, you\\'re going to do exactly as I say!\" I snapped. \\n\\nJacob was about to make another smart remark when he froze and looked past me toward the ticket counter. His mouth went wide. \"Roger... is that... you?\" I turned to see Darcey standing there, wearing what seemed to be a theater uniform behind the counter. \\n\\nHe was smiling in an odd but pleasant way. \\n\\n\"Roger? You\\'re alive, thank god,\" I said rushing over to him. \\n\\n\"Ah, Mister Saunders. Good to see you sir, I expect you\\'re ready for the upcoming filming?\" Roger said in a chipper tone. \\n\\nI frowned, wondering why Roger was calling me by the former owners name; but then when he saw Jacob his tone changed. \\n\\n\"You let her out.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" Jacob asked, equally confused by Darcey. \\n\\nThe man raised his finger toward both of us accusingly. Then he repeated the same phrase. \\n\\n\"You let her out. You let her out. You let her out.\" \\n\\nRoger kept repeating this phrase for a good long minute. Then he finally smiled again and coughed into his hand. \\n\\n\"Excuse me, sir. But are you ready to begin filming?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"Er... yes. Jacob just needed some help setting up the equipment. Might I ask what are we doing today?\" I said, hoping by assuming the role of Mister Saunders I would finally get some answers. \\n\\nRoger blinked for a moment and then laughed, \"Why; the next scene of *The Mooncreek Monster* of course.\"\\n\\n[330](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)',\n",

But as much as the Mooncreek gives, it also takes away. \\nAs I am writing this, it also pains me to report that one of the two men that started with me into this journey of the unknown is now gone forever; his own answers never resolved. It is my duty to finish this for him. To complete the puzzle I had been given by this accursed place. But before I can do that, I must honor the memory of Roger Darcey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During the long stretch of time that we wandered the seemingly endless halls of the basement below the Mooncreek, Roger and Jacob did their best to keep things sane by conversing amongst themselves and by attempting to map out the corridor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The latter was actually a great effort, as the two men devised a way for them to Mark the trail using rope, but as we had confirmed before this ordeal started; each time we did jot down a path, it seemed like the distance never got us any farther from the sealed vault. The matinee was forcing us to remain there until it saw fit to let us go, or so I thought. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The breaking point came last night, as Roger attempted to use his phone again to video the experience of the strange noises off in the distance. It was always just faint enough where his cellphone could not pick up the sound; so he decided on a different means of capturing the phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to go as far as I can,&amp;quot; he said standing up and using what little illumination he had available with the flash to see ahead of his feet. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was up as well, anxious to stop him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We agreed that we would stay together, Roger. For our safety,&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been down here god knows how long. Before long we&amp;#39;re going to starve. I&amp;#39;m tired of waiting!&amp;quot; Roger snapped back. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to Jacob for some kind of support, but he seemed to be in agreement with the plan. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can keep in contact. We&amp;#39;ve confirmed that our phones work down here... remember we attempted to call 911?&amp;quot; Jacob suggested. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that same event also confirms that we can&amp;#39;t guarantee our signal is getting out! Something wants us to stay down here, I think splitting up is a bad idea,&amp;quot; I said firmly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But neither of them listened to me. Roger activated his Skype and pointed his flash toward the darkened tunnel as the strange moaning noises started up once more. He gave us a thumbs up and walked into the bleak tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the last time we saw him alive. But we were witness to the strange occurrence of his demise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob held his own smartphone at an angle where I could see what was happening to Roger as he walked. Darcey was counting his steps, listening to the strange noises and then marking the wall. He repeated this for a good ten minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We should tell him to turn around. It&amp;#39;s just a ruse,&amp;quot; I muttered. Jacob held his hand up to shush me as he squinted his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that? Off in the distance?&amp;quot; he was pointing toward something that looked almost like a trick of the light. Was it a shadow? A figure? I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roger, I see something up ahead; adjust your camera,&amp;quot; Jacob ordered. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The other man obeyed and we watched as the flash veered the stream of light up ahead. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I saw what looked like a naked girl standing there, everything about her appeared human; except her face. There was none to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jesus Christ!&amp;quot; Roger said as he fumbled backward. Then he dropped the camera. Suddenly Jacob and I heard the strangest noise. It wasn&amp;#39;t quite footsteps. But it was loud and thundering. Then Roger began to scream. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shit.&amp;quot; Jacob started in a run down the hallway. In a panic I followed. On the Skype video, roger&amp;#39;s screams got louder and louder. His bones were breaking. Something was tearing him limb from limb. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then, just as suddenly; the noises stopped. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were still running, but neither of us could see anything in the dim tunnel. I grabbed ahold of Jacob and told him to stop. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s no use... we&amp;#39;ll never make it to him.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cobb looked at the smartphone again and clenched his teeth in frustration. There was no further sound being made on the video feed anymore. Whatever had come to find Roger was now long gone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We should go back, never know if it&amp;#39;s still close by,&amp;quot; I advised him. I didn&amp;#39;t want to think about that strange girl or to whatever she had done to Roger.

Can you be my friend?&amp;quot; the little girl asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob touched my shoulder to pull me away. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this one bit,&amp;quot; he muttered. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think... the theater is trying to tell us something.

I grabbed ahold of him and slung him against the wall. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t get to make the calls around here. I still don&amp;#39;t even know what role you play in this game, Cobb. So until I do, you&amp;#39;re going to do exactly as I say!&amp;quot; I snapped. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jacob was about to make another smart remark when he froze and looked past me toward the ticket counter. His mouth went wide. &amp;quot;Roger... is that... you?&amp;quot; I turned to see Darcey standing there, wearing what seemed to be a theater uniform behind the counter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was smiling in an odd but pleasant way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roger? You&amp;#39;re alive, thank god,&amp;quot; I said rushing over to him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, Mister Saunders. Good to see you sir, I expect you&amp;#39;re ready for the upcoming filming?&amp;quot; Roger said in a chipper tone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned, wondering why Roger was calling me by the former owners name; but then when he saw Jacob his tone changed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You let her out.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; Jacob asked, equally confused by Darcey. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man raised his finger toward both of us accusingly. Then he repeated the same phrase. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You let her out. You let her out. You let her out.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roger kept repeating this phrase for a good long minute. Then he finally smiled again and coughed into his hand. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me, sir. But are you ready to begin filming?&amp;quot; he asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Er... yes. Jacob just needed some help setting up the equipment. Might I ask what are we doing today?&amp;quot; I said, hoping by assuming the role of Mister Saunders I would finally get some answers. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roger blinked for a moment and then laughed, &amp;quot;Why; the next scene of &lt;em&gt;The Mooncreek Monster&lt;/em&gt; of course.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app\"&gt;330&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'It all started after our family moved to Connecticut not long ago. My wife, Marian, had been offered a job as a social media consultant, and she said she couldn\\'t pass up this opportunity. I knew as a family, we couldn\\'t. So we packed up our things and drove for nearly a week. We settled in, not expecting anything terribly exciting. Marian knew her job wasn\\'t flashy, but it paid more than a similar job she had in Boston, and we needed something to keep us afloat since I had been trying to \"make it\" as a writer. \\n\\nOur daughter, Rose, took to the new house immediately, spending hours in the backyard and almost getting lost in the woods beyond. I made a friend across the road, a man named Jonah. He invited me for a few beers one night, and I obliged. We ended up talking about everything. He lived in Connecticut for most of his life but lived with his grandfather for a couple of years after he got sick, and his wife Opal always wanted to buy a place in Kentucky and watch the grass roll away into nothing at all. \\n\\nEverything seemed to be going great actually. Talking to Jonah, that great hulk who wore nothing but flannel shirts and workman\\'s jeans, gave me ideas for the novel I had been working on. Marian said she was settling into her new job just fine, and Rose was making friends at school, but of course, she had a bully, as most kids do, a pissy little boy named Heath. I had half a mind to go down to the school and talk to Rose\\'s principal, but I never knew what to say in those situations. I was not good around authority figures, except for Jonah of course. Despite his great physical presence commanding immediate respect, he didn\\'t try to intimidate other people, trying to help them or encourage them instead. A great guy. \\n\\nMarian didn\\'t seem to like him though, which really surprised me. \\n\\n\"How could you not like Jonah?\" I asked. \"He\\'s been nothing but supportive of us. He even offered to paint our house for nothing!\" \\n\\n\"Look, he seems really nice on the surface, and I could be wrong. It\\'s just...I think he\\'s hiding something. I\\'m not sure what. Just a vibe, I guess.\"\\n\\nMarian and I had a little argument afterward. I just couldn\\'t believe she didn\\'t like Jonah. She was always more socially astute than I was though, and maybe my anger had more to do with being duped again for the hundredth time. But Jonah never gave any indication of something be off, or him not being what he seemed. And usually one gets that sense early on, and I felt like Jonah was the mentor I never had. A nice old man who lived a hard life, but tried to do right by people. \\n\\nWeeks went by, and I still talked to Jonah nearly every day, drinking beers and talking to him about my novel. He mentioned at one point that he wanted to be a writer too, but the old patriarch never approved. He had been a laborer ever since he was seven, painting houses and mowing lawns, said he never had time to live his dream.\\n\\nIt made me think how wrong Marian was about Jonah. Here this nice older man was, telling me about an unfulfilled dream, letting me live mine without the slightest bit of resentment. I just couldn\\'t fathom that he could be so different than was plainly obvious.\\n\\nOne night, though, made me doubt everything, turned that perception right on its head. A massive thunderstorm woke me up at roughly 1 in the morning, and I went to check on Rose just to make sure she hadn\\'t been startled, or didn\\'t wander out in the backyard which she did for the first several days after moving here, until we put locks high up on the doors. \\n\\n\"Rose, everything okay? You weren\\'t startled, where you?\" I asked. I talked quietly because I didn\\'t want to wake Marian. I looked at Rose\\'s bed, and through the intense flickering of the lightning, I could make out ruffled sheets and twisted pillows, but no Rose. I gasped and ran to the bed, turning on the light on the nightstand just to make sure I hadn\\'t been seeing things. Nothing. Just flashes of lightning on a wrinkled white sheet. \\n\\nI ran back to our bedroom, intending to wake Marian. But I saw something at the end of the hallway, near the window that we hadn\\'t put a curtain on yet. As the lightning continued to flash, I thought I saw something tall, with red, scaly skin, holding what looked like an oxygen mask. A large tank rested next to him, and the thing pointed at me. \\n\\nAfter the next flash, it was gone. I hurried the rest of the way to our bedroom and shook Marian awake. That was weeks ago. She immediately suspected Jonah, and despite my hot protests, told me to go over there and inspect his house. I felt fire rising in my belly, anger at Marian, but also fear. Jonah was a kindly man, altruistic and fatherly, but how would he react if I accused him, even implicitly, of kidnapping my daughter. \\n\\nBut, obviously, I loved Rose, and I would do anything to get her back. I marched over there, courage waning with each step, thinking about what I would say to Jonah. When I saw him face to face, I realized I couldn\\'t accuse him outright. I told him that Rose had run away, and that I wanted to check the all the houses in the area in case she was hiding in one of them. \\n\\n\"She loves hide and go seek,\" I said, which was true in a sense, but not on the scale I made it out to be. She did like to wander though, figured that was good enough. Jonah agreed, and I checked the upstairs and downstairs, and even the basement. Nothing.\\n\\nI met Opal for the first time, Jonah\\'s wife. She was a mean-looking woman, looking eighty instead of sixty-five. She gave me a polite nod, drinking a beer and playing solitaire. She didn\\'t look up from her cards, and I didn\\'t push an attempt at conversation. I thanked Jonah for his time, apologized for the inconvenience, and told him I\\'d be checking the other houses in the surrounding area. I said that Rose was good at sneaking into other houses, and it had become something of a nasty habit back in Boston, but our neighbors never said anything because they knew her well and the other children liked her. \\n\\nI told Marian about not seeing any hint of Rose over at Jonah\\'s. I told her the wife struck me as a bit odd, antisocial at the very least, but Jonah was more than accommodating, not seeming to have anything to hide at all. She continued to suspect him, and I continued to defend him, and said if anything, we should suspect Opal, who seemed eccentric to say the least. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we both went to bed angry that night. We\\'ve continued to argue about it as we\\'ve checked the neighbors\\' homes. I woke up that night, this time the alarm clock read 2:05. I noticed a large figure standing over me, red and scaly. He held that oxygen mask over me, and given the context, realized maybe the tank was filled with something else. It also struck me this was how Rose was kidnapped. I started to scream and struggle, and after several moments of this, the thing disappeared, leaving me to struggle with the sheets. Marian woke up, asked if I was okay. I nodded. Hesitantly, I told her what happened. She said believed me, but I could see the doubt in her eyes. \\n\\nThis happened over the next several nights, and every time I struggled against the thing, it disappears, leaving me to explain what I saw to Marian. I said that maybe I\\'m just having night terrors, being traumatized by Rose\\'s kidnapping. But I know it\\'s real. I know something is trying to put me to sleep, intending on taking to the same place where Rose is being held. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do.',\n",

Fate wasn’t ready for me to fall asleep quite yet, however. I was just on the cusp of darkness when a sudden meowing outside snapped me back to the real world.\\n\\nMy first groggy thought was: how did Boxer get outside? As I came to my senses, I realized that thought made absolutely no sense. There was no way my orange tabby had snuck out of the apartment. The meows continued, seemingly growing in desperation and intensity, and I quickly moved to the window to investigate.\\n\\nI saw a shadow darting back and forth on the ground below. It was a kitten, or at least it appeared to be—it was very skinny and small framed. I wondered if the poor thing was injured, or if it was looking for it owner. \\n\\nGrabbing a pair of gloves, I headed outside with a bag of treats. Almost immediately as I exited the building, the small cat bolted up to me and began furiously running back and forth between my legs, all while mewing its head off. Clearly it recognized that humans meant food. I dropped some treats on the ground and watched as the cat attacked them with no hesitation. \\n\\nIt was an extremely quiet night outside. The only sound penetrating the night air was the sound of the hungry cat chowing down, eating so rapidly that the sound was almost labored. Now that the cat was in the light outside the apartment door, I could see *him* a bit more clearly. His fur was jet-black, and he had very adorable facial features. Admittedly, he was a bit unhealthy looking.\\n\\nI made a snap decision. I ran back up to the apartment, grabbed a small grocery bag, and returned. As the cat finished up his meal, I quickly scooped him up and plopped him in the bag. He meowed briefly in protest, and I wondered if he was upset about being carried or upset I wasn’t giving him more food already.\\n\\nI decided I was going to keep him separate from my other cat for the night, just in case he had any sort of diseases or infections, and then I’d take him to the vet in the morning. I’d find out if he had a chip implanted in him, or if anyone had reported a cat missing. \\n\\nSecretly, I was hoping I’d get to keep him, and I was already brainstorming names.\\n\\nAs I entered the apartment, my cat Boxer was waiting at the door. Boxer was feisty—very affectionate, but feisty. As expected, he began hissing immediately as he smelled what was in the bag. To my surprise, the stray cat was completely silent, not even trying to assert itself in return. I quickly moved to my bedroom and shut the door on Boxer.\\n\\nI set the bag down, allowing my new visitor to get out and explore my bedroom. I grabbed him some more food and water, and moved a spare litter box into the bedroom. I had no idea if he would know how to use it, but the way I saw it, it wouldn’t be my first time cleaning up cat waste from the floor anyway.\\n\\nI was growing extremely exhausted, and began to pass out. As I was drifting off, I felt a sudden pressure press down on the end of the bed. I felt little footsteps slowly but surely move their way up the bed toward my face. They seemed to move very cautiously, as a cat does when it’s first exploring something new. My guest was going to cuddle with me for the night, it seemed.\\n\\nHe seemed to struggle a bit when he breathed. I had thought I’d noticed it when he was eating, but I was definitely hearing it now as he approached my ear. I figured the poor guy must have had an upper respiratory infection of sorts, which I knew was quite common in cats. \\n\\nHe was right by my ear now, and while I found it sort of endearing, the heavy breaths were indeed making it difficult to fall asleep. The outside of my ear tickled with each exhalation, and I couldn’t help but giggle a bit. Eyes still closed, I moved to push him gently away from me.\\n\\nBut my hand came into contact with nothing. As I opened my eyes, the breathing noises stopped abruptly. An uneasy knot formed in my stomach as I swung my head back and forth, looking for the cat I had rescued, but he was nowhere to be found on the bed with me.\\n\\nFinding a black cat in the pitch dark wasn’t going to be easy, so I moved quickly to the light and turned it on. As the room lit up I spotted him. He was curled up in the far corner of the room, looking comfortable and sleepy. He didn’t look like he had moved in a while, and I certainly hadn’t felt or heard him get off the bed.\\n\\nI was freaking myself out a bit at that point. Obviously he must have ran off when I moved. I wish he’d chosen somewhere else to relax, though. That corner had always made me feel uneasy at night—due to the way the outside lights came through the windows and dimly lit the room, it always seemed darker than the rest of the room. I guessed that may have been why the cat decided to rest there.\\n\\nI flipped off the overhead lights and instead turned on the small lamp on the nightstand. I decided it wouldn’t be so bad to sleep with it on.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI decided to name him Looker for his dashing appearance. After a while, him and Boxer eventually got along alright. Looker was always very passive, and eventually it became clear that there was a ladder of dominance going on in the apartment, in which Boxer was on top. On more than one occasion I caught Boxer scaring Looker away from his bowl and stealing his food. It was as if he was trying to say “This is my home, and I am allowing you to stay here.”\\n\\nI felt bad for Looker. I knew he must have had an owner in the past. He was far too comfortable interacting with me to be a cat that was stray its whole life. Not only that, but he had shown me that he knew how to use the litter box with no teaching. \\n\\nThe sad part was, nobody had claimed him or reported a missing cat matching his description. The 30-day time period had just passed, and Looker was officially mine. Watching him and Boxer play was the adorable new thing I had been needing in my life. I had absolutely no regrets about rescuing him.\\n\\nI still kept the two separate while I was asleep or away, as I’d caught them being a bit too rowdy with each other. Looker would always be shut in my bedroom while Boxer had his free reign in the living room. \\n\\nSo, as you can imagine, when I came home one day to find Boxer’s face covered in a few bloody scratches, I was dumbfounded. \\n\\nI ran to my bedroom and checked the door. It was shut tightly. There was no way Looker or Boxer could have even interacted with each other. I opened the door and spotted Looker lying lazily on the bed, looking cute as ever. Unlike Boxer, he was completely unscathed, which just made me more confused. If they had somehow fought despite being shut away from each other, you’d think both would have visible signs.\\n\\nI figured Boxer must have fallen or gotten his face caught on something. It was the only explanation after all. Washing the cuts out was a nightmare as Boxer squirmed and struggled. Boxer was certainly no exception to cats hating water, and it must have stung a bit for the poor guy too.\\n\\nI noticed some strange behavior in Boxer after that day. He no longer seemed to be the aggressive, territorial cat he once was. In fact, he was keeping his distance from Looker, and even seemed quite wary of him. Boxer refused to eat at the same time as Looker, and would only carefully walk up to his bowl once Looker was completely finished with his food.\\n\\nLooker, on the other hand, continued to act the same as ever. I didn’t doubt that he’d picked up on Boxer’s strange behavior too, though. I wondered if Boxer was potentially getting sick, and I even took him to the vet as my worry grew.\\n\\nAll the tests came back normal, and Boxer was supposedly a perfectly healthy cat. The behavioral changes could be explained by him getting used to the other cat living with us, the vet he said. I didn’t really think that Boxer’s attitude would realistically take a 180 degree turn on that basis, though.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI love my cat. I really do.\\n\\nEven when he woke me up at 3 in the morning, meowing for no apparent reason until his throat was raw. I opened the bedroom door, and though it seemed he wanted to leave the living room, he refused to come inside my room with Looker and I, either. He sat awkwardly at the threshold, still occasionally meowing. His little voice was hoarse as all hell, and I wondered how long he must have been sitting there before I’d awoken.\\n\\nI figured I’d let him decide which room he wanted to be in, and I quickly fell asleep again despite his noise making.\\n\\nWhen I woke up in the morning, however, he hadn’t made his decision. He still sat in between the two rooms—not even lying in any sort of comfortable way. I wondered if he had even laid down or slept at all the whole night. I got out of bed and moved to pet him, and as I did, I noticed he was visibly shivering. He winced as I gently stroked the fur atop his head, and I was feeling extremely concerned. He was not at all acting like himself.\\n\\nI attempted to pick him up, but he dug his nails into the carpet and planted himself firmly. He mewed in protest as I pulled harder. After a few seconds, I gave up on moving him. He clearly liked the exact spot he was in.\\n\\nI brushed past him, stepping into the living room area, and I gasped. The couch was heavily torn up and ripped open, and the material inside was scattered all over. It was utterly and completely destroyed. My cats had never touched the couch before—why now? And how did they do so much damage in one night?\\n\\nI wondered if it was Boxer or Looker, or both. Weirdly, neither had seemed to move much from their spots all night, and I certainly hadn’t heard anything in the living room overnight either. Feeling paranoid, I checked to make sure the front door was locked, and it was—the deadbolt was even on. \\n\\nI was pretty frustrated and annoyed, to say the least. It didn’t help that Boxer was acting so out of character and yet had been cleared by a vet. And Looker, as adorable as he was, was starting to get on my nerves as well. Laying in that corner of the room where he always laid, he seemed extremely relaxed and chill. As I stared at him and he gazed back, it was as if he was challenging me to blame him.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI spent most of my free time that day cleaning up the living room before heading to work. It was a long, exhausting day, as it tended to be. So, as night fell and it was finally time to clock out, I was more than ready to go home and hit the hay.\\n\\nIt was the first time I didn’t leave both cats on separate sides of a shut door while I was at work. After all, Boxer had refused to move from the doorway. I had been a little nervous about it all day, and I was hoping that they hadn’t gotten feisty with each other while I wasn’t there. I thought back to when Boxer’s face had been cut up, and I knew I really didn’t want anything like that to happen again to my poor little buddy.\\n\\nAs soon as I opened the door to the apartment, I felt very uneasy. I was ready to assess the damage that had occurred while I was gone. I turned on the light in the living room and immediately felt at least a slight bit of relief. Everything appeared how it was when I’d left. I didn’t see Boxer or Looker, though. I assumed both must be in the bedroom. I really hoped Boxer wasn’t still in that doorway.\\n\\nI made my way to the bedroom, where the door was slightly ajar due to how Boxer made me leave it. To my relief, I didn’t see him in the doorway. I flipped the light switch, and as the light came on, I saw one of the last sights I’d ever expected to see.\\n\\nIn Looker’s favorite spot in the whole apartment, that far corner of the room, both cats laid cuddling. Boxer was licking behind the ear of Looker, who seemed to be enjoying the company. I was completely dumbfounded. I had expected them to either fight or tear up the apartment, not to become infatuated with each other while I was gone.\\n\\nIt was so unexpected that I became a little unsettled. That damn corner—even now, with the bedroom light on, it almost seemed like a shadow hovered over it.\\n\\n“Okay guys, I know you’re enjoying this, but let’s move,” I said as I moved toward them. I bent down and touched Looker, and a chill travelled down my spine. His body was not warm and welcoming like I would have expected, but instead, his fur felt almost clammy and cool. Despite this, I wrapped my arms around him and began to stand, but he dug his claws firmly into the carpet, just as Boxer had done the previous night.\\n\\nWhat was going on with them? I let go of him and attempted to move Boxer, knowing I was likely going to get the same results. Disturbingly, his fur, too, felt icy and wet. I attempted to no avail to move him as he cried and complained hoarsely.\\n\\nI decided they must have been sick for sure. Cats hate being touched or picked up when they are sick, and it could explain their strange body temperatures. I wondered if I could afford to take them to the emergency vet, or if I could even wait until morning. What if it was only a matter of time before they couldn’t treat them? Or what if they passed away during the night? \\n\\nThe emergency vet was looking like a good option. Now I just had to find a way to force them into the pet carrier, as they were sticking to the carpet as tightly as they could. I quickly ran to the living room and grabbed the carrier.\\nWhen I walked back into the bedroom, however, the corner was vacant. I turned my head from side to side. There was no sign of either cat.\\n\\n“Looker?” I called.\\n\\nI stepped into the room and began to look around. My own hands felt clammy now, and I felt a bit of sweat drip down my forehead. Was that damn corner even darker than before? \\n\\n“Boxer?”\\n\\nSuddenly, I heard a hoarse little meow. It was so quiet that at first I wasn’t sure I really heard it. As I moved toward the source of the sound, though, Boxer meowed once more, and I knew for sure I wasn’t hearing things.\\n\\nBut my heart skipped a beat. The meowing was coming from inside the walk-in closet. The closet door had been shut, and it was still shut. There was little explanation as to how Boxer could have ended up inside there.\\n\\nI glanced uneasily at the corner. There was no mistaking it—there was clearly some sort of strange darkness creeping over it, and it seemed more prominent than it ever had. My heart was racing now, and I tried taking a deep breath. I was really managing to freak myself out, I thought. My imagination was running wild. \\n\\nBoxer cried out again from inside the closet. I reached out to the door, grabbed the handle, and quickly swung it open.\\n\\nThere was nothing but my clothing. Boxer was nowhere to be seen in the small closet. A few of my dress shirts hanging up appeared to be swaying from side to side ever so slightly, and I felt goosebumps form on my skin. Something had been moving in there.\\n\\nI stepped back slowly from the closet and shut the door. I didn’t want to look at the corner. I knew it was going to be worse. I always knew there was something wrong with that part of the room. Gritting my teeth and bracing for the worst, I turned my head slowly toward the corner.\\n\\nBut there was nothing. In fact, the corner seemed more well-lit than it ever had. I couldn’t help but sigh audibly in relief. \\n\\nI spotted movement in my peripheral vision. I whipped around, and to my surprise, there stood Looker on my bed.\\n\\n“Looker, buddy, hi,” I said, gushing. \\n\\nAs I approached him, though, a sinking feeling entered my chest. Something was very off about him. The way his leg bones seemed to have been knocked out of their proper places. The way one of his eyes was slightly higher up on his face than the other. \\n\\nThe way his mouth hung ajar.\\n\\nI watched in horror as, while Looker remained perfectly still, his shadow began to move. It warped and twisted and boiled. Its dark tendrils spread across the bed, onto the floor and up the walls. A quiet purring had begun to fill the room, seemingly coming from all around me, and it only got louder as the darkness permeated the entire room. \\n\\nI had never felt such a pure, visceral horror. The purring—or was it groaning?—was unbearably loud now. Looker’s body, while none of the limbs nor his face moved, was visibly shaking. It was so violent that even the bed was moving as if there was an earthquake. \\n\\nI somehow ended up on the ground, leaning back on my arms, looking up in pure terror as the shadows engulfed the room. I gasped as the light bulbs in the ceiling fixture above me shattered and shards of glass rained down on top of me. The noise, the horrible, grisly noise, was so extreme now that I felt like my eardrums were going to rupture. \\n\\nSuddenly, I spotted a blur of motion as it leapt onto the bed. There was a horrible, loud scream that sounded like it was half cat and half something else. On the bed two shapes rolled around on top of each other. Looker roared such a terrible, deep noise that no creature his size should be able to make. The other creature hissed back fiercely. It was a familiar, feisty hiss.\\n\\nThe shadows began to ebb and retreat, shrinking back toward the thing I’d thought was my cat. Meanwhile, the two creatures continued to struggle with each other on the bed. Though my legs felt like jelly, I found myself able to stand on them once more. Feeling like I was moving in slow motion, I made my way to the bedroom door, before breaking into a sprint and bursting out the front apartment door.\\n\\nI didn’t know where Boxer had come from, or where he had gone before, but he had given me the opportunity to escape. As I stood outside the apartment building, still trying to process the events that had just occurred, I became deathly afraid for Boxer. He was fighting something unearthly.\\n\\nI love my cat, I really do.\\n\\nBut I am an absolute coward.\\n\\nI didn’t step foot back into that apartment. Not until my lease was running out and I absolutely needed to empty the place. Even then, I had a few friends come with me, under the guise that I would need a lot of help. In reality, I was simply terrified to return.\\n\\nWhen we got there, there were no signs of anything strange having happened. The only relic of the events I had experienced was the shattered glass on the floor below the lighting fixture. \\n\\nNo Boxer. No Looker, either, thankfully. I told my friends they’d ran away. I had reported Boxer as missing, and I was really hoping someone would find him. I’ve yet to receive any updates on that front, unfortunately.\\n\\nBe wary of what you are inviting into your home. Evil exists out there, and it can’t always get in without permission. I still don’t know what it was, or how many like it are out there. If you live in my city, you may even encounter the creature I called Looker. But make no mistake: it’s not a cat. I don’t think it’s even a possessed cat. It’s something much worse, and it doesn’t have good intentions',\n",

Boxer refused to eat at the same time as Looker, and would only carefully walk up to his bowl once Looker was completely finished with his food.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Looker, on the other hand, continued to act the same as ever. I didn’t doubt that he’d picked up on Boxer’s strange behavior too, though. I wondered if Boxer was potentially getting sick, and I even took him to the vet as my worry grew.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All the tests came back normal, and Boxer was supposedly a perfectly healthy cat. The behavioral changes could be explained by him getting used to the other cat living with us, the vet he said. I didn’t really think that Boxer’s attitude would realistically take a 180 degree turn on that basis, though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love my cat. I really do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even when he woke me up at 3 in the morning, meowing for no apparent reason until his throat was raw. I opened the bedroom door, and though it seemed he wanted to leave the living room, he refused to come inside my room with Looker and I, either. He sat awkwardly at the threshold, still occasionally meowing. His little voice was hoarse as all hell, and I wondered how long he must have been sitting there before I’d awoken.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I figured I’d let him decide which room he wanted to be in, and I quickly fell asleep again despite his noise making.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I woke up in the morning, however, he hadn’t made his decision. He still sat in between the two rooms—not even lying in any sort of comfortable way. I wondered if he had even laid down or slept at all the whole night. I got out of bed and moved to pet him, and as I did, I noticed he was visibly shivering. He winced as I gently stroked the fur atop his head, and I was feeling extremely concerned. He was not at all acting like himself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I attempted to pick him up, but he dug his nails into the carpet and planted himself firmly. He mewed in protest as I pulled harder. After a few seconds, I gave up on moving him. He clearly liked the exact spot he was in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I brushed past him, stepping into the living room area, and I gasped. The couch was heavily torn up and ripped open, and the material inside was scattered all over. It was utterly and completely destroyed. My cats had never touched the couch before—why now? And how did they do so much damage in one night?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered if it was Boxer or Looker, or both. Weirdly, neither had seemed to move much from their spots all night, and I certainly hadn’t heard anything in the living room overnight either. Feeling paranoid, I checked to make sure the front door was locked, and it was—the deadbolt was even on. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was pretty frustrated and annoyed, to say the least. It didn’t help that Boxer was acting so out of character and yet had been cleared by a vet. And Looker, as adorable as he was, was starting to get on my nerves as well. Laying in that corner of the room where he always laid, he seemed extremely relaxed and chill. As I stared at him and he gazed back, it was as if he was challenging me to blame him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my free time that day cleaning up the living room before heading to work. It was a long, exhausting day, as it tended to be. So, as night fell and it was finally time to clock out, I was more than ready to go home and hit the hay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I didn’t leave both cats on separate sides of a shut door while I was at work. After all, Boxer had refused to move from the doorway. I had been a little nervous about it all day, and I was hoping that they hadn’t gotten feisty with each other while I wasn’t there. I thought back to when Boxer’s face had been cut up, and I knew I really didn’t want anything like that to happen again to my poor little buddy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I opened the door to the apartment, I felt very uneasy. I was ready to assess the damage that had occurred while I was gone. I turned on the light in the living room and immediately felt at least a slight bit of relief. Everything appeared how it was when I’d left. I didn’t see Boxer or Looker, though. I assumed both must be in the bedroom. I really hoped Boxer wasn’t still in that doorway.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I made my way to the bedroom, where the door was slightly ajar due to how Boxer made me leave it. To my relief, I didn’t see him in the doorway. I flipped the light switch, and as the light came on, I saw one of the last sights I’d ever expected to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In Looker’s favorite spot in the whole apartment, that far corner of the room, both cats laid cuddling. Boxer was licking behind the ear of Looker, who seemed to be enjoying the company. I was completely dumbfounded. I had expected them to either fight or tear up the apartment, not to become infatuated with each other while I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was so unexpected that I became a little unsettled. That damn corner—even now, with the bedroom light on, it almost seemed like a shadow hovered over it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay guys, I know you’re enjoying this, but let’s move,” I said as I moved toward them. I bent down and touched Looker, and a chill travelled down my spine. His body was not warm and welcoming like I would have expected, but instead, his fur felt almost clammy and cool. Despite this, I wrapped my arms around him and began to stand, but he dug his claws firmly into the carpet, just as Boxer had done the previous night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What was going on with them? I let go of him and attempted to move Boxer, knowing I was likely going to get the same results. Disturbingly, his fur, too, felt icy and wet. I attempted to no avail to move him as he cried and complained hoarsely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided they must have been sick for sure. Cats hate being touched or picked up when they are sick, and it could explain their strange body temperatures. I wondered if I could afford to take them to the emergency vet, or if I could even wait until morning. What if it was only a matter of time before they couldn’t treat them? Or what if they passed away during the night? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The emergency vet was looking like a good option. Now I just had to find a way to force them into the pet carrier, as they were sticking to the carpet as tightly as they could. I quickly ran to the living room and grabbed the carrier.\\nWhen I walked back into the bedroom, however, the corner was vacant. I turned my head from side to side. There was no sign of either cat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Looker?” I called.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped into the room and began to look around. My own hands felt clammy now, and I felt a bit of sweat drip down my forehead. Was that damn corner even darker than before? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Boxer?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I heard a hoarse little meow. It was so quiet that at first I wasn’t sure I really heard it. As I moved toward the source of the sound, though, Boxer meowed once more, and I knew for sure I wasn’t hearing things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But my heart skipped a beat. The meowing was coming from inside the walk-in closet. The closet door had been shut, and it was still shut. There was little explanation as to how Boxer could have ended up inside there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced uneasily at the corner. There was no mistaking it—there was clearly some sort of strange darkness creeping over it, and it seemed more prominent than it ever had. My heart was racing now, and I tried taking a deep breath. I was really managing to freak myself out, I thought. My imagination was running wild. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Boxer cried out again from inside the closet. I reached out to the door, grabbed the handle, and quickly swung it open.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was nothing but my clothing. Boxer was nowhere to be seen in the small closet. A few of my dress shirts hanging up appeared to be swaying from side to side ever so slightly, and I felt goosebumps form on my skin. Something had been moving in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped back slowly from the closet and shut the door. I didn’t want to look at the corner. I knew it was going to be worse. I always knew there was something wrong with that part of the room. Gritting my teeth and bracing for the worst, I turned my head slowly toward the corner.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But there was nothing. In fact, the corner seemed more well-lit than it ever had. I couldn’t help but sigh audibly in relief. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spotted movement in my peripheral vision. I whipped around, and to my surprise, there stood Looker on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Looker, buddy, hi,” I said, gushing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I approached him, though, a sinking feeling entered my chest. Something was very off about him. The way his leg bones seemed to have been knocked out of their proper places. The way one of his eyes was slightly higher up on his face than the other. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The way his mouth hung ajar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched in horror as, while Looker remained perfectly still, his shadow began to move. It warped and twisted and boiled. Its dark tendrils spread across the bed, onto the floor and up the walls. A quiet purring had begun to fill the room, seemingly coming from all around me, and it only got louder as the darkness permeated the entire room. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had never felt such a pure, visceral horror. The purring—or was it groaning?—was unbearably loud now. Looker’s body, while none of the limbs nor his face moved, was visibly shaking. It was so violent that even the bed was moving as if there was an earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I somehow ended up on the ground, leaning back on my arms, looking up in pure terror as the shadows engulfed the room. I gasped as the light bulbs in the ceiling fixture above me shattered and shards of glass rained down on top of me. The noise, the horrible, grisly noise, was so extreme now that I felt like my eardrums were going to rupture. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I spotted a blur of motion as it leapt onto the bed. There was a horrible, loud scream that sounded like it was half cat and half something else. On the bed two shapes rolled around on top of each other. Looker roared such a terrible, deep noise that no creature his size should be able to make. The other creature hissed back fiercely. It was a familiar, feisty hiss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The shadows began to ebb and retreat, shrinking back toward the thing I’d thought was my cat. Meanwhile, the two creatures continued to struggle with each other on the bed. Though my legs felt like jelly, I found myself able to stand on them once more. Feeling like I was moving in slow motion, I made my way to the bedroom door, before breaking into a sprint and bursting out the front apartment door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know where Boxer had come from, or where he had gone before, but he had given me the opportunity to escape. As I stood outside the apartment building, still trying to process the events that had just occurred, I became deathly afraid for Boxer. He was fighting something unearthly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love my cat, I really do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I am an absolute coward.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t step foot back into that apartment. Not until my lease was running out and I absolutely needed to empty the place. Even then, I had a few friends come with me, under the guise that I would need a lot of help. In reality, I was simply terrified to return.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we got there, there were no signs of anything strange having happened. The only relic of the events I had experienced was the shattered glass on the floor below the lighting fixture. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No Boxer. No Looker, either, thankfully. I told my friends they’d ran away. I had reported Boxer as missing, and I was really hoping someone would find him. I’ve yet to receive any updates on that front, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Be wary of what you are inviting into your home. Evil exists out there, and it can’t always get in without permission. I still don’t know what it was, or how many like it are out there. If you live in my city, you may even encounter the creature I called Looker. But make no mistake: it’s not a cat. I don’t think it’s even a possessed cat. It’s something much worse, and it doesn’t have good intentions&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Please if you\\'re reading this, take my advise. Do not wake your kid up, your sibling, or your husband/wife, or anyone up if they are smiling or laughing in their sleep. If I can save just 1 person from making the same mistake I did then this post was a success. Please, let me explain...\\n\\nLast night was just like any normal Sunday night. I put my newborn son to bed, turned on the baby monitor and sat in my recliner to watch some good ol t.v. to wind down from a rather annoying 12 hour work day. My wife Jenna was already upstairs in bed reading her book, turning in for the night. I was so exhausted... All I wanted to do was catch the evening news then go to bed, wake up, and repeat the same thing over again. If I would\\'ve had some sort of warning, I could\\'ve avoided this shit show and be at work right now, not hunkered down in my son\\'s room praying she doesn\\'t find us...\\n\\nThe news had nothing of interest on as usual. The weather, a meth had arrested, blah blah blah... Another typical night in central Michigan. Just as i turned the t.v. off to get ready for bed I heard a giggle come from upstairs. It sounded like my wife. I smiled at the thought of her laughing to herself as she hit a funny spot in her book. I really love that woman\\'s laugh... Well I did, now it terrifies me.\\n\\nI got up and dragged my feet up the stairs, feet throbbing from standing on them all day. Her laugh echoing through the silent house. I couldn\\'t help but feel a little uneasy, walking through the completely silent house other than my wife\\'s laughter cutting through the night. As I got to my bedroom door I couldn\\'t figure out why but I felt extremely un easy. The whole situation just felt wrong. I opened the door anyway and to my surprise the room was pitch black. One look at Jenna told me she was sleeping. She lay motionless and her eyes were softly shut, her chest rising and falling with each breath.\\n\\nMy blood froze as she let out another giggle. I don\\'t know why I felt so creeped out by her just laughing in her sleep but it felt so wrong. I sped walked over to her and as I got closer I noticed this huge grin spread across her face. It sent another wave of chills down my spine as I looked at her creepy grin.\\n\\n\"Jenna wake up.\" I shook her, unable to lay next to that smile.\\n\\nI wish I wouldn\\'t have tried to wake her up again but of course, I did.\\n\\n\"Jenna!\" I said a little louder, giving her a decent shake.\\n\\nHer eyes snapped open and it made me jump back and yelp. Even in the dark I could see her eyes were completely white, no pupil in the center.\\n\\n\"Heeeeey Braaaaad!\\' It sounded like 2 voices were talking, one kind of like the demons from evil dead, the other her own.\\n\\nI spun around and ran full blast from the room, crashing into Jacob\\'s (my son) room. I could hear her laughter roar throughout the house the same time as 2 loud thuds from her feet hitting the floor. I looked around frantically for any sort of weapon to use in case she got in and attacked. Thank God we hadn\\'t removed the lock from Jacobs room yet I thought as I locked the door quickly. I couldn\\'t find a damn thing to use as a weapon so I just leaned against the door with all my weight, praying she didn\\'t come our way.\\n\\n\"Wheeeerree aaaarrreee yooouuuuu!\" Her distorted voice called out.\\n\\nI silently prayed to god to help us, and for Jacob not to wake up and alert her of our hiding spot. She walked around for what felt like hours, occasionally sprinting up and down the hallways laughing. Luckily Jacob didn\\'t so much as make a peep throughout the night and I think that\\'s what saved our live\\'s. \\n\\nAfter hours of her doing this when the sun finally came up I heard her return to the bedroom and all was quiet again. I waited a good 30 minutes before leaving the room to check out what was going on, my heart pounding the whole time. As I creeped to the room I peeked my head in the door and thanked god as she was fast asleep. \\n\\nDid that just fucking happen?\\n\\nI went downstairs and called in to work as I had zero sleep. Probably 15 minutes later Jenna came down looking tired and grumpy, making me jump and scream like a little girl.\\n\\n\"The fuck is with you?\" She snapped, not a morning person at all.\\n\\nI just stared blankly at her, not knowing what to do. She shook her head in annoyance at me and walked out of the kitchen. I never did bring it up to her, she wouldn\\'t believe me anyway. I just told her I wasn\\'t feeling good and called in. After an hour or so I must\\'ve dozed off in my chair because when I woke up the house was silent. My heart raced remembering the events from the night before. I got up and checked Jacobs room and he was fast asleep, taking his afternoon nap. I tip toed to my room and peeked my head in to see if Jenna was in there.\\n\\n\"Heeeeey Braaaaad!\\' That same demonic voice called as soon as my head poked in.\\n\\nI booked it for Jacobs room once again, slamming and locking the door. I cursed myself for not bringing my phone but luckily Jenna must\\'ve left the tablet in here when laying Jacob down for a nap. I scrambled to get on messenger and wrote her mom asking her to come over. The hole time hearing Jenna run the halls laughing again. I know it sounds bad but when her mom gets here I\\'m hoping Jenna goes after her, giving me time to escape. I never liked the woman anyway...\\n\\nSo please everyone, DO NOT wake anyone up when smiling or laughing in their sleep!',\n",

Even in the dark I could see her eyes were completely white, no pupil in the center.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Heeeeey Braaaaad!&amp;#39; It sounded like 2 voices were talking, one kind of like the demons from evil dead, the other her own.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spun around and ran full blast from the room, crashing into Jacob&amp;#39;s (my son) room. I could hear her laughter roar throughout the house the same time as 2 loud thuds from her feet hitting the floor. I looked around frantically for any sort of weapon to use in case she got in and attacked. Thank God we hadn&amp;#39;t removed the lock from Jacobs room yet I thought as I locked the door quickly. I couldn&amp;#39;t find a damn thing to use as a weapon so I just leaned against the door with all my weight, praying she didn&amp;#39;t come our way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wheeeerree aaaarrreee yooouuuuu!&amp;quot; Her distorted voice called out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I silently prayed to god to help us, and for Jacob not to wake up and alert her of our hiding spot. She walked around for what felt like hours, occasionally sprinting up and down the hallways laughing. Luckily Jacob didn&amp;#39;t so much as make a peep throughout the night and I think that&amp;#39;s what saved our live&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After hours of her doing this when the sun finally came up I heard her return to the bedroom and all was quiet again. I waited a good 30 minutes before leaving the room to check out what was going on, my heart pounding the whole time. As I creeped to the room I peeked my head in the door and thanked god as she was fast asleep. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did that just fucking happen?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went downstairs and called in to work as I had zero sleep. Probably 15 minutes later Jenna came down looking tired and grumpy, making me jump and scream like a little girl.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The fuck is with you?&amp;quot; She snapped, not a morning person at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just stared blankly at her, not knowing what to do. She shook her head in annoyance at me and walked out of the kitchen. I never did bring it up to her, she wouldn&amp;#39;t believe me anyway. I just told her I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling good and called in. After an hour or so I must&amp;#39;ve dozed off in my chair because when I woke up the house was silent. My heart raced remembering the events from the night before. I got up and checked Jacobs room and he was fast asleep, taking his afternoon nap. I tip toed to my room and peeked my head in to see if Jenna was in there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Heeeeey Braaaaad!&amp;#39; That same demonic voice called as soon as my head poked in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I booked it for Jacobs room once again, slamming and locking the door. I cursed myself for not bringing my phone but luckily Jenna must&amp;#39;ve left the tablet in here when laying Jacob down for a nap. I scrambled to get on messenger and wrote her mom asking her to come over. The hole time hearing Jenna run the halls laughing again. I know it sounds bad but when her mom gets here I&amp;#39;m hoping Jenna goes after her, giving me time to escape. I never liked the woman anyway...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So please everyone, DO NOT wake anyone up when smiling or laughing in their sleep!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I don’t really like birds that much.   \\nI worked at a pet store for a while, and I know a handful of people that own, or have owned birds in the past. They’re loud, smelly, and they prefer to kick and peck seeds anywhere that isn’t their cage. They’re a pet for specific types of people, myself not included. \\n\\nDon’t get me wrong, I don’t hate birds, I just had no desire to have one as a pet. Which was why I was concerned for my mental wellbeing when I somehow became the host house and parental figure for several species of bird in my backyard.\\n\\nI don’t have a massive or interesting space outside. There’s one tree, a small garden, a shed, and a small deck with some patio furniture, all surrounded by a high fence. It’s enough to sit out and relax without worrying about prying neighbors, but not much else. Since I retired, I began storing some of my personal hobbies in the shed, along with a few gardening tools so I could spend more time outside. \\n\\nThe birds didn’t all appear at once, but I made the mistake of being too nice to one too many of them, and suddenly my yard became some sort of aviary. \\n\\nI put out a small bird feeder for the little brown ones I saw hopping around on my tree. They’re the ones you see in droves shuffling out from underneath your car or nesting in the giant letters of your favorite big box store. \\n\\nThe robins were the next frequent visitors, plucking worms out of the garden and making the bird feeder swing as they came barreling in to swipe some of the seeds for themselves. The blue jays were a bit of a rare sight in the beginning, but the shock of their bright plumage began to appear more often along the fence as the days went on. \\n\\nI didn’t have a birdbath or anything, just that one feeder. Apparently, that was enough for word to travel through the bird grapevine, and my house became the hottest spot for birds in the whole town. In the span of two weeks I went from a few birds going in and out of the birdfeeder at a time, to tens of birds hanging out in my tree and on my fence, taking turns pecking at my one lonely bird feeder all day long. \\n\\nI accepted my fate the first time that bird feeder ran out in a single day. \\n\\nI looked at the situation logically. These weren’t my pets; they were wild animals. They wouldn’t be living in my house, so I wouldn’t have to deal with the smell trapped inside. They could take care of themselves if they were desperate, free to roam and never return to my house if they chose to. They also polished off every seed that fell out of the birdfeeder. \\n\\nI lived on the side of a busy road where the houses were spread a bit further apart to keep the speed limit from dropping below sixty kilometers per hour, so I wasn’t really worried about the neighbors becoming too interested in my new hobby. \\n\\nIf the poop got too bad, I could just hose down the backyard in a few quick sweeps while watering the garden. I didn’t see any real downsides to it, so I went out the next day, bought another bird feeder to hang up in the tree, a hummingbird feeder for the deck, and a birdbath for the garden. \\n\\nIf I was committing to a bird sanctuary, I was going all out. I was living alone at the time, and I oddly enjoyed having so many colourful birds to look at in the backyard. I’d miss it if they stopped coming here.\\n\\nThe crows came a few days later, and it was a strange spectacle. I suppose in the urban jungle, crows were something of royalty. The other birds would squawk and shuffle out of their way as they hopped from branch to branch, their obsidian bodies massive in comparison to many of the other birds. \\n\\nI think for a period of time they scared away several of the others, but eventually they found their own balance amongst each other, and everyone settled back in. \\n\\nI grew more accustomed to the presence of so many birds, and eventually I started talking to them. Begrudgingly, mind you, like they were my misbehaving children, especially the crows. They were almost like the school bully, or a sibling always looking for a fight. \\n\\n“Wait your turn, go sit with the others on the tree. Don’t be a brat.” \\n\\n“Go sit on the fence, you’re too big for that branch, you’ll snap it and scare the little ones.”\\n\\n“Don’t bother the hummingbirds, they haven’t done anything to you.” \\n\\nNow, just as I was getting more comfortable with the birds, they were getting increasingly more comfortable with me. At first, they would fly away and watch me from the tree as I filled the feeder, but eventually they just fluttered to the end of the deck, some of them brave enough to creep up closer and chirp at me. \\n\\n“Yea, yea. It has to get filled at some point. You can wait thirty seconds to keep eating.” I muttered, turning and raising an eyebrow and the handful of little brown birds that all looked up at me with wide eyes. I had to admit, it was pretty cute. \\n\\nA crow cawed loudly at me from the edge of the fence nearby, interrupting my moment. \\n\\n“You can quiet down over there. Let them go first.” I scolded with narrowed eyes. “Here...” I grumbled, grabbing a handful of seed from my bag and backing away from the feeder, the smaller birds instantly pouncing on the contraption.\\n\\nThe crow regarded me carefully as I walked to a different section of the deck, crouching down to put a pile of seeds on the planks of wood. I could hear the beating of their wings as three crows immediately landed a few feet away from where I was kneeling. \\n\\n“Hey! Hold on a second.” I glared up at them. All three shockingly obeyed, freezing in their approach. I looked at them individually, an amused smile creeping over my face. \\n\\n“Alright, have at it.” I laughed, standing up, the seeds at my feet. They didn’t even bother waiting for me to move away, hopping over and pecking at the pile once I’d given the go ahead. \\n\\nThe birds continued to surprise me in the following weeks, especially the crows. I knew that they were smart birds, but it threw me for a loop sometimes at how well they seemed to pick up exactly what I was saying. \\n\\nMy nagging seemed to hold more weight now, and they watched me more closely. They usually didn’t come over to me unless there was food involved, but it was an interesting development, and honestly a better system. \\n\\nThey left the little ones alone most of the time now and waited patiently for me to hand feed them instead. I knew this could potentially be a bad thing, getting too attached to the wildlife, the wildlife getting too attached to me. I knew. I just did it anyways. \\n\\nThe crows were funny. I started feeding them bits of my own food as well, since I knew crows were scavengers and would probably eat anything, not just seeds. One day I hadn’t even put my scraps down and I felt a weight drop down suddenly onto my head. The wing flaps gave away what it was, but it startled a laugh out of me. \\n\\n“So impatient.” I muttered, but my lips were spread in a smile. They grew more comfortable with me, and even went so far as to come investigate and hang out with me even when I didn’t have any food. That was a big step. \\n\\nI had five crows that frequented my yard, and they would all park themselves at various points around me as I read a book or browsed my phone or laptop. I often puttered around in the shed too, but I kept them out of it. They didn’t like being barred from the shed, but it was basically the same rules as the house. They’d always squawk at me if I was taking too long, all of them perched on the roof waiting for me to come out. \\n\\nThe next step was touching, and it was mostly accidental at first. I’d shift my position or stand up after an hour or two of sitting on a patio chair and startle them into moving. Eventually I had to gently nudge some of them out of the way in order to get up, one of them deciding that my lap was a good place to settle if my laptop wasn’t there, or my shoulder if it was. \\n\\nI didn’t ramble on, or tell them extensive stories, but they followed my command and came when I called. I didn’t need to name them, but I knew the five of them apart. They were always watching me when I was in the yard, and all I had to do was look at whoever I was talking to, and they understood. \\n\\nOne day I was pleasantly surprised when one of them brought me a gift. It wasn’t anything special. It was literally just a stick, but I laughed, and I took it with a, “Thanks for the present buddy.” and a little two-finger pat on his feathered head. \\n\\nNot all of them took up the gift giving, thank god. Having two of them battling it out was enough. They would each bring me something at the end of the day that they’d found around town. \\n\\nI had a bucket that I kept outside, I’d take their little rock or their piece of plastic, and I’d give them a little scratch and a thank you before I’d put it in. They were small enough items that it didn’t fill up the bucket very fast, a piece of a plastic spoon, a doll’s shoe, a shiny candy wrapper, the list goes on. \\n\\nThey picked up early on that I didn’t really like food, because I would take it in the house to put in the small compost bin and not into the bucket like the others. Another day I got a shiny ring and felt a bit guilty about it. There weren’t any markings, and I didn’t have the time or energy to do anything about it, but I couldn’t have them stealing valuable things and bringing too much attention to me. I took it inside, and they got the same message they did with the food; no precious metals. \\n\\nThey picked up on a lot of things, the smart birds. \\n\\nOne day I was sitting around with my feet up, laptop on my lap, a crow on my shoulder, two crows on the table beside me and a crow on one of the armrests I wasn’t using. The one on my shoulder had already given his gift for the day and was rather pleased with himself. \\n\\n“Wonder where the other one is, heh?” I asked aloud to none of them in particular, distracted by my laptop. Ten minutes later I heard the beat of wings but didn’t bother looking up as I finished typing my paragraph. \\n\\nI felt pressure on my other shoulder, and then something tumbled abruptly down the front of my shirt and landed on my lap. My hands froze on the keyboard as my eyes flickered to my newest gift. \\n\\nAn eyeball stared up at me, blood trailing messily down the front of my shirt and onto my pants. It was partially deflated, a puss-like goop mixing in with the blood where it had landed and oozed out. It must have been punctured by the crow’s beak as he carried it. \\n\\nI stared at the eyeball blankly for another moment, trying to process what to do. A dead animal was one thing, but this was clearly a human eyeball. My heart hammered in my chest as the crow shifted its feet around on my shoulder, clearly waiting for his praise.\\n\\nI carefully lifted myself out of the chair, grabbing the gooey mess in one of my hands. The birds hopped off my shoulder, their heads twisting to watch what I would do with the organ that had been so gracefully plopped into my lap.\\n\\nI glanced over to the shed, staring at the crack in the door. I must have left it unlocked accidentally this morning, and it hadn’t shut all the way. I thought carefully, before shuffling my way inside. \\n\\nThe crow let out a squawk, disappointed at my current trajectory. \\n\\n“One second buddy.” I said with a grimace, as I tried to think. I walked quickly in and down to the basement, trying not to let the slimy mess in my hand drip onto the floor. It only took me a few minutes to find it, and I let out a relieved breath. \\n\\n“All of you, come here.” I called carefully as I emerged back out into the yard. The crows shifted uneasily, flapping their wings in confusion as I walked over to the shed. They hesitated, wary, but eventually flew over to the grass where I stood in front of it. \\n\\nI had the eye in one hand, and a new, shiny bucket in the other.\\n\\nI set the bucket down and opened the shed doors wide so they could all take a good look inside. It was clear that the one who’d brought me the gift had snuck in and taken a peek anyways, and brought me something he thought I’d like. \\n\\nHundreds of eyes stared out from inside the shed, pristine and perfect in their jars lining every shelf I'd built to hold them. \\n\\nThe new bucket was identical to the one I kept beside my chair on my deck. I was lucky I had a spare. I knelt and put it inside the shed, letting the eyeball slide off my hand and thunk down into it. That one certainly wasn’t usable, but perhaps I would receive one in better condition in the future, if I played my cards right.\\n\\n“These go in an extra special bucket, okay? Good job.” I grinned, and the crow hopped excitedly up to me for some well-deserved head scratches. Some of the others cawed and peered around me inside the shed with their heads cocked in curiosity. \\n\\nI really do love my murder of crows.\",\n",

Let them go first.” I scolded with narrowed eyes. “Here...” I grumbled, grabbing a handful of seed from my bag and backing away from the feeder, the smaller birds instantly pouncing on the contraption.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crow regarded me carefully as I walked to a different section of the deck, crouching down to put a pile of seeds on the planks of wood. I could hear the beating of their wings as three crows immediately landed a few feet away from where I was kneeling. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey! Hold on a second.” I glared up at them. All three shockingly obeyed, freezing in their approach. I looked at them individually, an amused smile creeping over my face. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Alright, have at it.” I laughed, standing up, the seeds at my feet. They didn’t even bother waiting for me to move away, hopping over and pecking at the pile once I’d given the go ahead. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The birds continued to surprise me in the following weeks, especially the crows. I knew that they were smart birds, but it threw me for a loop sometimes at how well they seemed to pick up exactly what I was saying. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My nagging seemed to hold more weight now, and they watched me more closely. They usually didn’t come over to me unless there was food involved, but it was an interesting development, and honestly a better system. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They left the little ones alone most of the time now and waited patiently for me to hand feed them instead. I knew this could potentially be a bad thing, getting too attached to the wildlife, the wildlife getting too attached to me. I knew. I just did it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crows were funny. I started feeding them bits of my own food as well, since I knew crows were scavengers and would probably eat anything, not just seeds. One day I hadn’t even put my scraps down and I felt a weight drop down suddenly onto my head. The wing flaps gave away what it was, but it startled a laugh out of me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So impatient.” I muttered, but my lips were spread in a smile. They grew more comfortable with me, and even went so far as to come investigate and hang out with me even when I didn’t have any food. That was a big step. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had five crows that frequented my yard, and they would all park themselves at various points around me as I read a book or browsed my phone or laptop. I often puttered around in the shed too, but I kept them out of it. They didn’t like being barred from the shed, but it was basically the same rules as the house. They’d always squawk at me if I was taking too long, all of them perched on the roof waiting for me to come out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next step was touching, and it was mostly accidental at first. I’d shift my position or stand up after an hour or two of sitting on a patio chair and startle them into moving. Eventually I had to gently nudge some of them out of the way in order to get up, one of them deciding that my lap was a good place to settle if my laptop wasn’t there, or my shoulder if it was. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ramble on, or tell them extensive stories, but they followed my command and came when I called. I didn’t need to name them, but I knew the five of them apart. They were always watching me when I was in the yard, and all I had to do was look at whoever I was talking to, and they understood. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day I was pleasantly surprised when one of them brought me a gift. It wasn’t anything special. It was literally just a stick, but I laughed, and I took it with a, “Thanks for the present buddy.” and a little two-finger pat on his feathered head. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not all of them took up the gift giving, thank god. Having two of them battling it out was enough. They would each bring me something at the end of the day that they’d found around town. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had a bucket that I kept outside, I’d take their little rock or their piece of plastic, and I’d give them a little scratch and a thank you before I’d put it in. They were small enough items that it didn’t fill up the bucket very fast, a piece of a plastic spoon, a doll’s shoe, a shiny candy wrapper, the list goes on. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They picked up early on that I didn’t really like food, because I would take it in the house to put in the small compost bin and not into the bucket like the others. Another day I got a shiny ring and felt a bit guilty about it. There weren’t any markings, and I didn’t have the time or energy to do anything about it, but I couldn’t have them stealing valuable things and bringing too much attention to me. I took it inside, and they got the same message they did with the food; no precious metals. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They picked up on a lot of things, the smart birds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day I was sitting around with my feet up, laptop on my lap, a crow on my shoulder, two crows on the table beside me and a crow on one of the armrests I wasn’t using. The one on my shoulder had already given his gift for the day and was rather pleased with himself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wonder where the other one is, heh?” I asked aloud to none of them in particular, distracted by my laptop. Ten minutes later I heard the beat of wings but didn’t bother looking up as I finished typing my paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt pressure on my other shoulder, and then something tumbled abruptly down the front of my shirt and landed on my lap. My hands froze on the keyboard as my eyes flickered to my newest gift. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An eyeball stared up at me, blood trailing messily down the front of my shirt and onto my pants. It was partially deflated, a puss-like goop mixing in with the blood where it had landed and oozed out. It must have been punctured by the crow’s beak as he carried it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at the eyeball blankly for another moment, trying to process what to do. A dead animal was one thing, but this was clearly a human eyeball. My heart hammered in my chest as the crow shifted its feet around on my shoulder, clearly waiting for his praise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I carefully lifted myself out of the chair, grabbing the gooey mess in one of my hands. The birds hopped off my shoulder, their heads twisting to watch what I would do with the organ that had been so gracefully plopped into my lap.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced over to the shed, staring at the crack in the door. I must have left it unlocked accidentally this morning, and it hadn’t shut all the way. I thought carefully, before shuffling my way inside. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The crow let out a squawk, disappointed at my current trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“One second buddy.” I said with a grimace, as I tried to think. I walked quickly in and down to the basement, trying not to let the slimy mess in my hand drip onto the floor. It only took me a few minutes to find it, and I let out a relieved breath. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“All of you, come here.” I called carefully as I emerged back out into the yard. The crows shifted uneasily, flapping their wings in confusion as I walked over to the shed. They hesitated, wary, but eventually flew over to the grass where I stood in front of it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had the eye in one hand, and a new, shiny bucket in the other.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I set the bucket down and opened the shed doors wide so they could all take a good look inside. It was clear that the one who’d brought me the gift had snuck in and taken a peek anyways, and brought me something he thought I’d like. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of eyes stared out from inside the shed, pristine and perfect in their jars lining every shelf I&amp;#39;d built to hold them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The new bucket was identical to the one I kept beside my chair on my deck. I was lucky I had a spare. I knelt and put it inside the shed, letting the eyeball slide off my hand and thunk down into it. That one certainly wasn’t usable, but perhaps I would receive one in better condition in the future, if I played my cards right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“These go in an extra special bucket, okay? Good job.” I grinned, and the crow hopped excitedly up to me for some well-deserved head scratches. Some of the others cawed and peered around me inside the shed with their heads cocked in curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I really do love my murder of crows.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Despite this, at 0333, an individual of an exact identical features to Volunteer 4 entered Room 17C, took a hold of Volunteer 1’s hair and pulled, removing Volunteer 1’s head and spine. &lt;strong&gt;Compound JKL-926&lt;/strong&gt; administered to Room 17C, had no effect on Volunteer 4.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At 0333, &lt;strong&gt;FAILSAFE RLM-0505&lt;/strong&gt; employed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At 0334, Volunteer 4 entered Room 22C and proceeded to penetrate Volunteer 5’s mouth and throat with spine of Volunteer 1. Volunteer 4 then disemboweled Volunteer 5. &lt;strong&gt;Compound JKL-926&lt;/strong&gt; administered to Room 22C, had no effect on Volunteer 4.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At 0335, security personnel approached Room 22C. SP2V3466 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;] fired a round from service pistol at Volunteer 4, no damage was done. [&lt;strong&gt;POSSIBLE FEED GLITCH&lt;/strong&gt;] Volunteer 4 moved from center of room to southwest corner of room (door to Room 22C) by apparent teleportation, reached down the throat of SP2V3466 to Volunteer 4’s elbow, and pulled arm through the front of SP2V3466’s body. Shots fired by SP4G9897 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;] had no effect on Volunteer 4. Volunteer 4 removed the jawbone of SP4G9897. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At 0336, Volunteer 4 entered Room 29C, spoke with Volunteer 6. [&lt;strong&gt;TRANSCRIPT ATTACHED&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 6: Is that you? [Yelling] IS THAT YOU?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 4: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 6: [Yelling] WHY?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 4: Better fit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 4 proceeded to break the fingers, thumbs, wrists, elbows, toes, feet, ankles, shins, knees, hip bones, ribs, sternum, collarbone, back, and neck of Volunteer 6.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At 0343, Volunteer 4 exited room 29C. Volunteer 4 removed specialized doors, bypassing &lt;strong&gt;FAILSAFE RLM-0505&lt;/strong&gt;. Volunteer 4 dispatched SP2M4513 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP2A7548 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP3F0098 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP3B1246 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP2K0810 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP5C7430 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], SP4L5739 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], ES1D4346 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], ES1C1967 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;], and ET3W6676 [&lt;strong&gt;DECEASED&lt;/strong&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer 4 no longer on Spaulding campus as of 0356.

I wasn\\'t having a dream though, I was having a nightmare. I was in a forest somewhere and there was a set of stairs leading to nowhere in the middle of a clearing. Just a set of wooden stairs stretching up towards a pitch black night sky flecked with a million specs of light. The stairs seemed to be calling me towards them, asking me to ascend into the heavens, but I had the unequivocal feeling that doing so would only result in calling evil into the world...\\n\\n*Knock knock, knock knock knock, knock knock, knock.*\\n\\nCharlie gave me a nudge and I begrudgingly opened my eyes.\\n\\nSarah and Dan were already getting up to open the door to Padre Cliffe. My arse was numb where I\\'d slept on only half of the beanbag, but I\\'d had a good five hours of sleep and felt rested. Charlie yawned and then shot me a smile. He was definitely an attractive guy, more boyish than handsome, but still must\\'ve got some attention from the females on camp. We\\'d never chatted about whether he was seeing anyone though.\\n\\nSarah opened the door to Padre Cliffe, who looked as cheerful as ever.\\n\\n\"Hello all, I hope you managed to get some sleep. I\\'ve got some bad news. I\\'ll cut straight to it. You\\'ll have to stay in the church tonight.\"\\n\\nI wasn\\'t too perturbed by the prospect. The church was definitely a better place to sleep than a lot of other places I\\'d sleep with the military, plus Charlie and Sarah and even Dan weren\\'t too bad company. The main negative was that I could see it being a rather boring evening with not much to do to kill the time between getting back from scoff and whenever we\\'d eventually get to sleep. On the other hand, a boring and uneventful night would be nice after last night.\\n\\nUneventful nights are my favourite nights.\\n\\n\"I tried phoning the duty corporal,\" he began, \"but it was the RAF PTI and I don\\'t really know him that well. Cpl Wilson? Do you know him? Anyway, I didn\\'t want to say too much because that would\\'ve required more explanation than I think we want to give, plus they\\'ve all been busy trying to contain the... problems... as a result of the power cut this morning.\"\\n\\nThe four of us kind of looked at each other. We weren\\'t aware of any power cut, but then again, we\\'d been locked in a room full of static so we wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\nPadre Cliffe smiled.\\n\\n\"I think that was probably your fault,\" he grinned at us, \"or at least it matches the times you said you were chatting  to aliens. 0400hrs until 0730hrs, roughly?\"\\n\\n\"No idea,\" I said, \"beside the obvious, everything seemed normal and we had power. Or at least the television was on.\"\\n\\nThe other three made noises of agreement.\\n\\n\"Mary and I slept through it too,\" smiled the padre, \"but it hit the base and the surrounding areas quite hard. Apparently some things need to be contained, especially down by the sewage treatment plant and the onion factory.\"\\n\\nI detected a slight smirk as Padre Cliffe pronounced the last words. He was referring to Parripak, a company that made chilled vegetable products just outside of camp. I had no idea what might need containing in an onion factory as a result of a power cut.\\n\\n\"Whereabouts in the church? asked Sarah.\\n\\n\"Well! I\\'m not going to make you sleep on a pew, dear,\" boomed Padre Cliffe, \"I think that here will be just fine, but I\\'ll try and get you a few more cushions and maybe some sleeping bags. Could you not get yours from your room, Private Brand?\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather not go back to the accommodation block tonight, Padre.\" I explained, \"I can\\'t be bothered answering too many questions about what I\\'ve been up to and where I\\'m going.\"\\n\\n\"I get that,\" nodded the padre, \"sometimes it\\'s good to sit down with just the people you shared a disturbing or traumatic event with and talk through how you felt and things. You don\\'t need to feel like you\\'re being interrogated by outsiders. I\\'ll go see if I can pick up some things for you al to sleep on. Shall we meet back here at 1830hrs or 1900hrs? Bearing in mind the centre closes today at 1900hrs?\"\\n\\nThe centre contained the church, the padre\\'s office and a few others, a kitchen, meeting rooms, the meditation room, toilets, etc. It essentially functioned as a welfare and spiritual hub on camp and there was normally something to other going on there. We\\'d been quite lucky to get 5 hours unbroken kip, although I couldn\\'t actually be certain how often the meditation room was used.\\n\\nIt was nearly 1730hrs.\\n\\n\"Can we meet at 1900hrs?\" I answered before anyone else could, \"I\\'d like to buy a few bits and pieces from the NAAFI after we\\'ve been to scoff. Just maybe a newspaper to read and maybe some biscuits and stuff for the night?\"\\n\\nI figured it was best to have something to do to keep myself entertained later.\\n\\n\"Of course!\" smiled Padre Cliffe, \"That works fine for me.\"\\n\\nThe four of us traipsed up the hill to the scoff house. Corrado and Sexton were just arriving as we got there and both looked pleased to see me, which was heartening. At least some folk would notice if I just disappeared off the face of the Earth.\\n\\nI spooned half a spoon of boiled baby carrots onto my plate, followed by a couple of potatoes and a chicken breast. Being a typical Yorkshireman from Hull (or wherever I\\'m from) I lathered the entire plate in gravy. I was suddenly pretty hungry and realised we hadn\\'t eaten since 0900hrs that morning.\\n\\n\"So where did you go last night?\" enquired Sexton as we walked to the table, \"you never answered my text!\"\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t out last night. I was drinking with these three and playing Risk. Didn\\'t see your message until ages later and figured you\\'d be drunk or had forgotten so no point in replying.\"\\n\\n\"Oh. I was sure I\\'d seen you out at one point,\" Sexton looked confused as he said it, \"but I was pretty drunk, to be fair.\"\\n\\nCorrado wanted to know more about our night at Sarah\\'s house. Our replies involved a fair bit of omission, which didn\\'t seem to be a problem as Corrado and Sexton were more than happy to move the conversation back onto their own night out and the antics that they\\'d gotten up to in town.\\n\\n\"One of the guys in the squad ahead pissed in the street and got caught by a copper,\" laughed Corrado, \"he\\'s gunna be fucked on Monday morning when the training staff find out.\"\\n\\nIt was nice to have a normal conversation, but as we were all leaving the scoff house together Corrado pulled me to one side and asked me what was going on between me and Charlie.\\n\\n\"Ummm, we\\'re just friends,\" I said, a bit miffed, \"why would you think otherwise?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m just saying that we\\'re good whatever. If you\\'re good, I\\'m good. OK?\"\\n\\nHis smile looked forced, but knowing that he was genuinely trying to look out for me I smiled back and clapped him on the shoulder.\\n\\n\"Come on.\"\\n\\nCorrado and Sexton peeled off into the block and I headed to the NAAFI with Sarah, Dan and Charlie to pick up supplies for the night.\\n\\nWe got to the church at 1850hrs.\\n\\nPadre Cliffe arrived 5 minutes later, carrying two sleeping bags by the straps in one hand, one in the other, and two pillows under his arms. He looked younger than he was. You could tell by his solid build that he used to be pretty ripped, but the muscle had softened nearly into fat. He kept what was left of his hair cropped short. Despite him always seeming jolly and his smile rarely leaving his face, his eyes betrayed a man who had killed and whom it would be unwise to cross.\\n\\n\"Five minutes before!\" he called when he was about 50ft away. He was referring to soldiers having to arrive at an appointment or meeting point five minutes before the scheduled time. If you were supposed to be at the armoury at 0600hrs, then you\\'d arrive at 0555hrs at the absolute latest.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry but I could only get three sleeping-bags. Take the pillows, please,\" he instructed, \"and I\\'ll just get the keys.\"\\n\\nThe four of us stripped him of all three sleeping-bags and both pillows. He fumbled around for a couple of keys and we followed him inside.\\n\\n\"This is the key for my office,\" he said holding up the first key, \"you can use it to get into my office and use the landline if you need to.\"\\n\\nI was sure that our mobiles would suffice, but I suppose landlines are superior to the older generation.\\n\\n\"This is the key to the meditation room,\" he held up the next key, \"but I don\\'t think you\\'ll need to lock that. And this is the key to the main entrance to the centre. You\\'ll have to lock me out when I leave.\"\\n\\nHe held up the last key.\\n\\n\"Christine, the caretaker, would normally be locking up right about now, but I\\'ve had to tell her we\\'ll do it because we don\\'t want the alarm setting tonight because you\\'d set the alarm off moving around in the night. That reminds me, both the toilets and the kitchen are unlocked, so if you want a brew or a biscuit then help yourself. The biscuits are in the kitchen, not the toilet.\"\\n\\nHe winked.\\n\\nIt was already getting dark outside and the night sky glowed a deep Royal Blue colour. The light pollution from the surrounding areas outshone the stars and none were visible despite Chicksands rural location, nestled in the enigma that was Rowney Warren Woods.\\n\\nChristine appeared from around the corner of the hallway.\\n\\n\"Good evening, Lawrence,\" she greeted Padre Cliffe, \"are these our guests for the night?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, Christine,\" confirmed the padre, \"I think you\\'ll recognise Sarah. Then there\\'s her cousin Charlie, her boyfriend Dan, and one of the trainees, Private Brand.\"\\n\\nHe gestured to each of us as he said our names.\\n\\n\"What\\'s your Christian name, dear?\" Christine asked me with a smile.\\n\\n\"Er, Porky,\" I answered awkwardly sticking out my hand to shake hers, \"nice to meet you.\"\\n\\nShe took hold of my fingertips and gave them a single shake. In hindsight, I realise that offering her my hand to shake was a little strange and I probably came across as socially awkward - I\\'m not - but it was just one of those things that seemed the right thing to do in that split second.\\n\\n\"Well,\" stated Christine, \"I think Lawrence has everything in hand. I\\'m leaving the alarms turned off, right?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, my dear. I\\'ll explain everything to the four of them over a cup of tea before I head home.\" said the padre.\\n\\n\"Hmmm, well make sure the cups are washed up and put away afterwards. I don\\'t want to be tidying up before the Sunday service tomorrow.\" Christine half-huffed, but something betrayed that she wasn\\'t really too bothered by the prospect. I made a mental note to leave everything as we found it, however.\\n\\nChristine said her goodbyes and disappeared out of the main door of the centre.\\n\\n\"Right,\" chirped Padre Cliffe, \"let\\'s get ourselves that brew and I\\'ll lay down some ground rules. I don\\'t think anyone has ever stayed overnight in the church centre before.\"\\n\\nMost of the lights in the place were turned off, but there was enough moonlight from curtainless windows to allow us to pick our way along the hallway to the kitchen. Padre Cliffe turned first turned on the kitchen light, which flickered twice before deciding it wanted to work, and then the kettle. Sarah got cups out of a cupboard while me, Dan and Charlie put the sleeping bags and pillows in a neat pile in the corner and pulled up chairs at the table. I put my little plastic bag of goodies from the NAAFI on the floor at the side of me.\\n\\nDan made a brief effort to talk to Charlie about football, but Charlie protested that it wasn\\'t really his cup of tea.\\n\\nExcuse the pun.\\n\\nA few minutes later we were all gathered round the table nursing hot drinks. Sarah had let Padre Cliffe have the fourth and final chair and was half-perched on Dan\\'s knee and half sharing his chair.\\n\\nI offered Kit-Kats from the NAFAFI supplies I\\'d bought, but Padre Cliffe convinced me to save them for later and have a chocolate Bourbon from the big biscuit tin instead.\\n\\n\"Right,\" began the padre, \"I can\\'t very well let you all sleep here without at least giving you some ground rules. It\\'s a bit naughty of me to let you sleep here at all, but as you know Christine knows you\\'re staying and she seems alright with it. She didn\\'t ask too many questions, but was rather worried you might be cold and uncomfortable. Personally I think you\\'ll be fine. The alarm is turned off so you have free run of the building without having to worry about setting it off, but as Christine said, make sure you leave everything as you find it. You\\'re welcome to biscuits and tea, but I\\'d appreciate you knot making fry-ups with the church supplies.\"\\n\\nPadre Cliffe was referring to some of the sausage, bacon, and/or egg sandwiches that the church kitchen sold for visitors to the centre.\\n\\nSuddenly, his expression changed and his demeanour took on a more serious feel.\\n\\n\"My only concern,\" he started in a more hushed tone, \"is Bella.\"\\n\\nHe paused. Both Charlie and I looked at Sarah, figuring that with Padre Cliffe being a family friend, she might know who the padre was referring to. Sarah said nothing, but the padre had noticed our confused looks.\\n\\n\"She\\'s nothing to worry about per se,\" he reassured us, \"but she might give you a shock if you\\'re on your way to the toilet in the dark and catch a glimpse of her in the hallway.\"\\n\\nThe four of us were completely lost.\\n\\nIt was Dan who finally asked the question we were all thinking.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s Bella?\"\\n\\nThe padre sighed and then smiled. He was the one who was now looking at Sarah.\\n\\n\"Well, Sarah might not remember me telling her, but Bella is the church grim,\" said the padre in a very matter-of-fact tone.\\n\\nHe paused just long enough for Sarah to protest.\\n\\n\"Ah, you mentioned grims to me aaaages ago, Lawrence, but you never told me it had a name.\"\\n\\nThe padre seemed to try and and remember the previous conversation he\\'d had with Sarah and then continued.\\n\\n\"Fair enough, you\\'re probably right. I\\'m old and can\\'t remember everything very well. Bella is *her* name\" - he emphasised \\'her\\' - \"and she protects the church from evil spirits and such like... that reminds me, Private Brand; you said you weren\\'t christened, I believe? I want to offer you some advice, OK?\"\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\"Get yourself an adult baptism. I can do it for you. There\\'s no place for a full immersion on Chicksands, unless you want to go swimming in the River Flit, but I know a church in Shefford where we can do it.\"\\n\\nShefford was the nearest village to Chicksands.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t sure if the padre was joking or just trying to convert me, but I nodded my agreement despite telling myself it was something I\\'d probably never do.\\n\\nPadre Cliffe returned to the topic of Bella.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be scared of her if you do see her, but also don\\'t approach her. She might come and give you a sniff to make sure that you don\\'t pose any risk to the church and aren\\'t demons of some kind, but that\\'s all.\"\\n\\nThe story seemed pretty fanciful to me, but given the events of the night before and the other mysterious goings on at Chicksands I decided that it was better to believe than to be caught unawares at a later date.\\n\\nAll the talk of mysterious black dogs had got me thinking though and I felt compelled to ask Padre Cliffe if the huge dog I\\'d seen around four months ago on Ex Final Fling might\\'ve been a grim.\\n\\n\"Padre,\" I said nervously, \"when I was at basic training, on the final exercise, I saw a massive black dog whilst on stag. It came up to me and another recruit but ran off when I stood up and approached it. Might that\\'ve been a grim?\"\\n\\nPadre Cliffe looked at me thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"There are two telltale signs, Private Brand,\" said the padre with an air of authority on the subject, \"the first is whether the dog in question appeared solid or spectral. The second is if you were near to a church or other hallowed land. So, given that information, you tell me! Did you see a grim?\"\\n\\nThe dog I saw that night was definitely solid and unless we\\'d camped on an unmarked burial ground, I was pretty certain the area we were wasn\\'t hallowed. It was just a military training area.\\n\\n\"No, it wasn\\'t spectral and we were just in a woods on the training area,\" I told him, \"it was just a big black, very real, pretty savage looking, dog.\"\\n\\n\"What breed was it?\" he asked and then added, \"Bella is a labrador,\" before I could reply.\\n\\n\"No idea,\" I said, \"I didn\\'t recognise the breed. It was just very big.\"\\n\\nCharlie, Dan and Sarah had listened to the exchange inquisitively whilst sipping at their drinks.\\n\\nThe padre took a long last swig of his and stood up. Sarah followed suit.\\n\\n\"Right, I\\'m going to get off. Can you wash this up for me, dear?\"  he handed Sarah his cup.\\n\\nSarah stayed behind in the kitchen to wash up our cups, I followed the padre to the main entrance to lock the door after him, and Charlie and Dan took the sleeping bags, pillows, and my shopping bag to the meditation rooms to set up for the night.\\n\\nAs soon as Padre Cliffe left, the silence hit me. The feeling of being alone in a large building lit only by moonlight heightened my primordial senses and I felt more alert, even though I knew that Sarah and Dan and Charlie weren\\'t that far away at all.\\n\\nI retraced my steps to the kitchen to find it empty. The five cups we\\'d used were draining on the side board.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t have been gone longer than a few minutes and hadn\\'t seen Sarah pass me on her way to the meditation room. Apart from the speed she must\\'ve washed the cups up at, there was nothing unusual in that; the church centre was arranged in a square shape and it was just as easy to reach the meditation room by way of the back corridor that ran parallel to the corridor that the main entrance was located on.\\n\\nI slowly made my way round to the meditation room, the unfamiliarity of the place at night making me check over my shoulder every few steps. The sound of rain hitting the windows started up and I hoped that Padre Cliffe made it back to his quarters without getting soaked.\\n\\nEven by the time I made it to the end of the corridor the noise from the wind outside had picked up considerably and it was clear there\\'d be a storm tonight. I was just glad that I was with other people and the meditation room would surely be.\\n\\nOnly thirty seconds later as I approached the door to our bedroom for the night, the rain was bouncing off the glass and the wind was howling in it\\'s efforts to squeeze into any crevices it could find.\\n\\n\"... whilst he\\'s sleeping...\" I heard Dan\\'s voice say.\\n\\n\"... a crime...\" replied Charlie.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t close enough to make out everything that was said and the wind was snapping their sentences into fragments.\\n\\n\"...trying to get him for weeks...\" said Sarah.\\n\\nIt would be easy to say that I should\\'ve stopped and listened to the conversation through the door, but I didn\\'t. I wanted to get settled in for the night and was at the door before I\\'d even properly processed what was being said.\\n\\n\"Hey,\" they chimed in unison as I entered the room.\\n\\nThe room flashed twice in quick succession.\\n\\nCharlie and Sarah shot each other worried glances and then a few seconds later there was a low rumbling from outside the window. It was thunder and lightning.\\n\\n\"Fuuuck,\" said Charlie under his breath, \"we hate thunder.\"\\n\\nHe looked nervous, but Sarah looked scared. I thought about my grandma back home in East Anglia (or wherever I\\'m from) and how she was also fearful of thunder and lightning. I\\'d once nearly had a heart attack as a small boy of around 5 because, whilst staying at her house, she\\'d camped outside my door during a thunderstorm and scared me shitless as I left my room to go for a pee.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got you,\" said Dan to Sarah. Then he looked at Charlie and laughed, \"you\\'re on your own though.\"\\n\\nI never asked them what they\\'d been talking about before I arrived because the conversation shifted to our experiences of storms as children. Sarah remembered camping as a kid one weekend and the experience being completely ruined by a torrential downpour because her over-confident military dad hadn\\'t checked the weather forecast beforehand.\\n\\nDan told a story about being trapped at school when a thunderstorm at home-time meant most of the students refused to leave the building to brave the rain and the walk home.\\n\\nCharlie remembered it raining in his bedroom due to a leaky roof \\'flooding\\' the attic, which then began dripping onto his bed whilst he was laid watching TV.\\n\\nDespite the storm raging outside, the atmosphere in the meditation room was relaxed. We chatted about our childhoods and shared Kit-Kats and a few bottles of coke I\\'d got. It was a bit like a sleep-over and the bizarre nature of last night\\'s incident seemed to have been forgotten. Dan and Sarah tried to share a sleeping bag but soon realised that that was impossible.\\n\\nI offered them them mine and told them I\\'d be fine.\\n\\nI\\'d spent colder nights on exercise and with the a pillow and a beanbag I was more than comfortable.\\n\\nFor a while we speculated on what the Grey aliens wanted, if Sarah\\'s dad knew of their existence and what the Ouija board did when turned on, and what would happen over the next few days. Sarah and I both accepted that we\\'d probably be in a fair amount of trouble and could only hope that Padre Cliffe would fight our corner as much as possible. I was still dreading seeing Chucky again.\\n\\nAfter a few hours Sarah and Dan fell asleep.\\n\\nIt was about 2200hrs.\\n\\nFor the next hour or so, Charlie and I chatted about his work at the bar and his relationship with his cousin. He\\'d not spent loads of time with his dad when he was younger, and when Sarah had moved to Chicksands it meant he could spend time with her and his Uncle Jack - Sgt Maj Jones to me - doing manly things.\\n\\nSlowly the temperature dropped and Christine\\'s fears of me being cold and uncomfortable became a bit more real.\\n\\nCharlie seemed to notice.\\n\\n\"Here,\" he said, \"if we unzip the sleeping bag we can use it as a quilt and share.\"\\n\\nHe smiled his brilliant smile.\\n\\nI was a bit apprehensive at first, but realised I wouldn\\'t sleep at all tonight if I didn\\'t accept his offer. We pushed our beanbags together and laid beneath the sleeping bag together. I placed my spare pillow between us to make it a little bit less gay.\\n\\nCharlie fell asleep first and the sound of his breathing actually helped me drift off.\\n\\nThe last time I checked my phone - which was still on about 23% after over a day, phone batteries lasted longer back then - it was 2304hrs.\\n\\nI followed Charlie into the land of nod not five minutes later. The storm continued to try and break in through the window.\\n\\nAt midnight the four of us were awoken by the deafening toll of the church bell...',\n",

[Part 8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get straight into things, because we never know when these might abruptly end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knock knock, knock knock knock, knock knock, knock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the knocking started I was in that weird state that&amp;#39;s kind of halfway between sleeping and halfway between being awake, where you seem to have control over the dream you&amp;#39;re having. I wasn&amp;#39;t having a dream though, I was having a nightmare. I was in a forest somewhere and there was a set of stairs leading to nowhere in the middle of a clearing. Just a set of wooden stairs stretching up towards a pitch black night sky flecked with a million specs of light. The stairs seemed to be calling me towards them, asking me to ascend into the heavens, but I had the unequivocal feeling that doing so would only result in calling evil into the world...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knock knock, knock knock knock, knock knock, knock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie gave me a nudge and I begrudgingly opened my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah and Dan were already getting up to open the door to Padre Cliffe. My arse was numb where I&amp;#39;d slept on only half of the beanbag, but I&amp;#39;d had a good five hours of sleep and felt rested. Charlie yawned and then shot me a smile. He was definitely an attractive guy, more boyish than handsome, but still must&amp;#39;ve got some attention from the females on camp. We&amp;#39;d never chatted about whether he was seeing anyone though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah opened the door to Padre Cliffe, who looked as cheerful as ever.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello all, I hope you managed to get some sleep. I&amp;#39;ve got some bad news. I&amp;#39;ll cut straight to it. You&amp;#39;ll have to stay in the church tonight.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t too perturbed by the prospect. The church was definitely a better place to sleep than a lot of other places I&amp;#39;d sleep with the military, plus Charlie and Sarah and even Dan weren&amp;#39;t too bad company. The main negative was that I could see it being a rather boring evening with not much to do to kill the time between getting back from scoff and whenever we&amp;#39;d eventually get to sleep. On the other hand, a boring and uneventful night would be nice after last night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Uneventful nights are my favourite nights.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I tried phoning the duty corporal,&amp;quot; he began, &amp;quot;but it was the RAF PTI and I don&amp;#39;t really know him that well. Cpl Wilson? Do you know him? Anyway, I didn&amp;#39;t want to say too much because that would&amp;#39;ve required more explanation than I think we want to give, plus they&amp;#39;ve all been busy trying to contain the... problems... as a result of the power cut this morning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The four of us kind of looked at each other. We weren&amp;#39;t aware of any power cut, but then again, we&amp;#39;d been locked in a room full of static so we wouldn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Padre Cliffe smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think that was probably your fault,&amp;quot; he grinned at us, &amp;quot;or at least it matches the times you said you were chatting  to aliens. 0400hrs until 0730hrs, roughly?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No idea,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;beside the obvious, everything seemed normal and we had power. Or at least the television was on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The other three made noises of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mary and I slept through it too,&amp;quot; smiled the padre, &amp;quot;but it hit the base and the surrounding areas quite hard. Apparently some things need to be contained, especially down by the sewage treatment plant and the onion factory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I detected a slight smirk as Padre Cliffe pronounced the last words. He was referring to Parripak, a company that made chilled vegetable products just outside of camp. I had no idea what might need containing in an onion factory as a result of a power cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whereabouts in the church? asked Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well! I&amp;#39;m not going to make you sleep on a pew, dear,&amp;quot; boomed Padre Cliffe, &amp;quot;I think that here will be just fine, but I&amp;#39;ll try and get you a few more cushions and maybe some sleeping bags. Could you not get yours from your room, Private Brand?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d rather not go back to the accommodation block tonight, Padre.&amp;quot; I explained, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t be bothered answering too many questions about what I&amp;#39;ve been up to and where I&amp;#39;m going.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I get that,&amp;quot; nodded the padre, &amp;quot;sometimes it&amp;#39;s good to sit down with just the people you shared a disturbing or traumatic event with and talk through how you felt and things. You don&amp;#39;t need to feel like you&amp;#39;re being interrogated by outsiders. I&amp;#39;ll go see if I can pick up some things for you al to sleep on. Shall we meet back here at 1830hrs or 1900hrs? Bearing in mind the centre closes today at 1900hrs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The centre contained the church, the padre&amp;#39;s office and a few others, a kitchen, meeting rooms, the meditation room, toilets, etc. It essentially functioned as a welfare and spiritual hub on camp and there was normally something to other going on there. We&amp;#39;d been quite lucky to get 5 hours unbroken kip, although I couldn&amp;#39;t actually be certain how often the meditation room was used.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was nearly 1730hrs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can we meet at 1900hrs?&amp;quot; I answered before anyone else could, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to buy a few bits and pieces from the NAAFI after we&amp;#39;ve been to scoff. Just maybe a newspaper to read and maybe some biscuits and stuff for the night?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I figured it was best to have something to do to keep myself entertained later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course!&amp;quot; smiled Padre Cliffe, &amp;quot;That works fine for me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The four of us traipsed up the hill to the scoff house. Corrado and Sexton were just arriving as we got there and both looked pleased to see me, which was heartening. At least some folk would notice if I just disappeared off the face of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spooned half a spoon of boiled baby carrots onto my plate, followed by a couple of potatoes and a chicken breast. Being a typical Yorkshireman from Hull (or wherever I&amp;#39;m from) I lathered the entire plate in gravy. I was suddenly pretty hungry and realised we hadn&amp;#39;t eaten since 0900hrs that morning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So where did you go last night?&amp;quot; enquired Sexton as we walked to the table, &amp;quot;you never answered my text!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t out last night. I was drinking with these three and playing Risk. Didn&amp;#39;t see your message until ages later and figured you&amp;#39;d be drunk or had forgotten so no point in replying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh. I was sure I&amp;#39;d seen you out at one point,&amp;quot; Sexton looked confused as he said it, &amp;quot;but I was pretty drunk, to be fair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corrado wanted to know more about our night at Sarah&amp;#39;s house. Our replies involved a fair bit of omission, which didn&amp;#39;t seem to be a problem as Corrado and Sexton were more than happy to move the conversation back onto their own night out and the antics that they&amp;#39;d gotten up to in town.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of the guys in the squad ahead pissed in the street and got caught by a copper,&amp;quot; laughed Corrado, &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s gunna be fucked on Monday morning when the training staff find out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was nice to have a normal conversation, but as we were all leaving the scoff house together Corrado pulled me to one side and asked me what was going on between me and Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ummm, we&amp;#39;re just friends,&amp;quot; I said, a bit miffed, &amp;quot;why would you think otherwise?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just saying that we&amp;#39;re good whatever. If you&amp;#39;re good, I&amp;#39;m good. OK?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His smile looked forced, but knowing that he was genuinely trying to look out for me I smiled back and clapped him on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Corrado and Sexton peeled off into the block and I headed to the NAAFI with Sarah, Dan and Charlie to pick up supplies for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We got to the church at 1850hrs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Padre Cliffe arrived 5 minutes later, carrying two sleeping bags by the straps in one hand, one in the other, and two pillows under his arms. He looked younger than he was. You could tell by his solid build that he used to be pretty ripped, but the muscle had softened nearly into fat. He kept what was left of his hair cropped short. Despite him always seeming jolly and his smile rarely leaving his face, his eyes betrayed a man who had killed and whom it would be unwise to cross.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Five minutes before!&amp;quot; he called when he was about 50ft away. He was referring to soldiers having to arrive at an appointment or meeting point five minutes before the scheduled time. If you were supposed to be at the armoury at 0600hrs, then you&amp;#39;d arrive at 0555hrs at the absolute latest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry but I could only get three sleeping-bags. Take the pillows, please,&amp;quot; he instructed, &amp;quot;and I&amp;#39;ll just get the keys.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The four of us stripped him of all three sleeping-bags and both pillows. He fumbled around for a couple of keys and we followed him inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is the key for my office,&amp;quot; he said holding up the first key, &amp;quot;you can use it to get into my office and use the landline if you need to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was sure that our mobiles would suffice, but I suppose landlines are superior to the older generation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is the key to the meditation room,&amp;quot; he held up the next key, &amp;quot;but I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll need to lock that. And this is the key to the main entrance to the centre. You&amp;#39;ll have to lock me out when I leave.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He held up the last key.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Christine, the caretaker, would normally be locking up right about now, but I&amp;#39;ve had to tell her we&amp;#39;ll do it because we don&amp;#39;t want the alarm setting tonight because you&amp;#39;d set the alarm off moving around in the night. That reminds me, both the toilets and the kitchen are unlocked, so if you want a brew or a biscuit then help yourself. The biscuits are in the kitchen, not the toilet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He winked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was already getting dark outside and the night sky glowed a deep Royal Blue colour. The light pollution from the surrounding areas outshone the stars and none were visible despite Chicksands rural location, nestled in the enigma that was Rowney Warren Woods.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Christine appeared from around the corner of the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good evening, Lawrence,&amp;quot; she greeted Padre Cliffe, &amp;quot;are these our guests for the night?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s right, Christine,&amp;quot; confirmed the padre, &amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;ll recognise Sarah. Then there&amp;#39;s her cousin Charlie, her boyfriend Dan, and one of the trainees, Private Brand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He gestured to each of us as he said our names.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your Christian name, dear?&amp;quot; Christine asked me with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Er, Porky,&amp;quot; I answered awkwardly sticking out my hand to shake hers, &amp;quot;nice to meet you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She took hold of my fingertips and gave them a single shake. In hindsight, I realise that offering her my hand to shake was a little strange and I probably came across as socially awkward - I&amp;#39;m not - but it was just one of those things that seemed the right thing to do in that split second.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; stated Christine, &amp;quot;I think Lawrence has everything in hand. I&amp;#39;m leaving the alarms turned off, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s right, my dear. I&amp;#39;ll explain everything to the four of them over a cup of tea before I head home.&amp;quot; said the padre.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmmm, well make sure the cups are washed up and put away afterwards. I don&amp;#39;t want to be tidying up before the Sunday service tomorrow.&amp;quot; Christine half-huffed, but something betrayed that she wasn&amp;#39;t really too bothered by the prospect. I made a mental note to leave everything as we found it, however.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Christine said her goodbyes and disappeared out of the main door of the centre.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right,&amp;quot; chirped Padre Cliffe, &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s get ourselves that brew and I&amp;#39;ll lay down some ground rules. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone has ever stayed overnight in the church centre before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the lights in the place were turned off, but there was enough moonlight from curtainless windows to allow us to pick our way along the hallway to the kitchen. Padre Cliffe turned first turned on the kitchen light, which flickered twice before deciding it wanted to work, and then the kettle. Sarah got cups out of a cupboard while me, Dan and Charlie put the sleeping bags and pillows in a neat pile in the corner and pulled up chairs at the table. I put my little plastic bag of goodies from the NAAFI on the floor at the side of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dan made a brief effort to talk to Charlie about football, but Charlie protested that it wasn&amp;#39;t really his cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Excuse the pun.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later we were all gathered round the table nursing hot drinks. Sarah had let Padre Cliffe have the fourth and final chair and was half-perched on Dan&amp;#39;s knee and half sharing his chair.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I offered Kit-Kats from the NAFAFI supplies I&amp;#39;d bought, but Padre Cliffe convinced me to save them for later and have a chocolate Bourbon from the big biscuit tin instead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right,&amp;quot; began the padre, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t very well let you all sleep here without at least giving you some ground rules. It&amp;#39;s a bit naughty of me to let you sleep here at all, but as you know Christine knows you&amp;#39;re staying and she seems alright with it. She didn&amp;#39;t ask too many questions, but was rather worried you might be cold and uncomfortable. Personally I think you&amp;#39;ll be fine. The alarm is turned off so you have free run of the building without having to worry about setting it off, but as Christine said, make sure you leave everything as you find it. You&amp;#39;re welcome to biscuits and tea, but I&amp;#39;d appreciate you knot making fry-ups with the church supplies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Padre Cliffe was referring to some of the sausage, bacon, and/or egg sandwiches that the church kitchen sold for visitors to the centre.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, his expression changed and his demeanour took on a more serious feel.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My only concern,&amp;quot; he started in a more hushed tone, &amp;quot;is Bella.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He paused. Both Charlie and I looked at Sarah, figuring that with Padre Cliffe being a family friend, she might know who the padre was referring to. Sarah said nothing, but the padre had noticed our confused looks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about per se,&amp;quot; he reassured us, &amp;quot;but she might give you a shock if you&amp;#39;re on your way to the toilet in the dark and catch a glimpse of her in the hallway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The four of us were completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was Dan who finally asked the question we were all thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s Bella?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The padre sighed and then smiled. He was the one who was now looking at Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, Sarah might not remember me telling her, but Bella is the church grim,&amp;quot; said the padre in a very matter-of-fact tone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He paused just long enough for Sarah to protest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, you mentioned grims to me aaaages ago, Lawrence, but you never told me it had a name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The padre seemed to try and and remember the previous conversation he&amp;#39;d had with Sarah and then continued.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fair enough, you&amp;#39;re probably right. I&amp;#39;m old and can&amp;#39;t remember everything very well. Bella is &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; name&amp;quot; - he emphasised &amp;#39;her&amp;#39; - &amp;quot;and she protects the church from evil spirits and such like... that reminds me, Private Brand; you said you weren&amp;#39;t christened, I believe? I want to offer you some advice, OK?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get yourself an adult baptism. I can do it for you. There&amp;#39;s no place for a full immersion on Chicksands, unless you want to go swimming in the River Flit, but I know a church in Shefford where we can do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shefford was the nearest village to Chicksands.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the padre was joking or just trying to convert me, but I nodded my agreement despite telling myself it was something I&amp;#39;d probably never do.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Padre Cliffe returned to the topic of Bella.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be scared of her if you do see her, but also don&amp;#39;t approach her. She might come and give you a sniff to make sure that you don&amp;#39;t pose any risk to the church and aren&amp;#39;t demons of some kind, but that&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The story seemed pretty fanciful to me, but given the events of the night before and the other mysterious goings on at Chicksands I decided that it was better to believe than to be caught unawares at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All the talk of mysterious black dogs had got me thinking though and I felt compelled to ask Padre Cliffe if the huge dog I&amp;#39;d seen around four months ago on Ex Final Fling might&amp;#39;ve been a grim.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Padre,&amp;quot; I said nervously, &amp;quot;when I was at basic training, on the final exercise, I saw a massive black dog whilst on stag. It came up to me and another recruit but ran off when I stood up and approached it. Might that&amp;#39;ve been a grim?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Padre Cliffe looked at me thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are two telltale signs, Private Brand,&amp;quot; said the padre with an air of authority on the subject, &amp;quot;the first is whether the dog in question appeared solid or spectral. The second is if you were near to a church or other hallowed land. So, given that information, you tell me! Did you see a grim?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dog I saw that night was definitely solid and unless we&amp;#39;d camped on an unmarked burial ground, I was pretty certain the area we were wasn&amp;#39;t hallowed. It was just a military training area.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, it wasn&amp;#39;t spectral and we were just in a woods on the training area,&amp;quot; I told him, &amp;quot;it was just a big black, very real, pretty savage looking, dog.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What breed was it?&amp;quot; he asked and then added, &amp;quot;Bella is a labrador,&amp;quot; before I could reply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No idea,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t recognise the breed. It was just very big.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie, Dan and Sarah had listened to the exchange inquisitively whilst sipping at their drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The padre took a long last swig of his and stood up. Sarah followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right, I&amp;#39;m going to get off. Can you wash this up for me, dear?&amp;quot;  he handed Sarah his cup.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah stayed behind in the kitchen to wash up our cups, I followed the padre to the main entrance to lock the door after him, and Charlie and Dan took the sleeping bags, pillows, and my shopping bag to the meditation rooms to set up for the night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as Padre Cliffe left, the silence hit me. The feeling of being alone in a large building lit only by moonlight heightened my primordial senses and I felt more alert, even though I knew that Sarah and Dan and Charlie weren&amp;#39;t that far away at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I retraced my steps to the kitchen to find it empty. The five cups we&amp;#39;d used were draining on the side board.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t have been gone longer than a few minutes and hadn&amp;#39;t seen Sarah pass me on her way to the meditation room. Apart from the speed she must&amp;#39;ve washed the cups up at, there was nothing unusual in that; the church centre was arranged in a square shape and it was just as easy to reach the meditation room by way of the back corridor that ran parallel to the corridor that the main entrance was located on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slowly made my way round to the meditation room, the unfamiliarity of the place at night making me check over my shoulder every few steps. The sound of rain hitting the windows started up and I hoped that Padre Cliffe made it back to his quarters without getting soaked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even by the time I made it to the end of the corridor the noise from the wind outside had picked up considerably and it was clear there&amp;#39;d be a storm tonight. I was just glad that I was with other people and the meditation room would surely be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Only thirty seconds later as I approached the door to our bedroom for the night, the rain was bouncing off the glass and the wind was howling in it&amp;#39;s efforts to squeeze into any crevices it could find.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... whilst he&amp;#39;s sleeping...&amp;quot; I heard Dan&amp;#39;s voice say.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... a crime...&amp;quot; replied Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t close enough to make out everything that was said and the wind was snapping their sentences into fragments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...trying to get him for weeks...&amp;quot; said Sarah.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to say that I should&amp;#39;ve stopped and listened to the conversation through the door, but I didn&amp;#39;t. I wanted to get settled in for the night and was at the door before I&amp;#39;d even properly processed what was being said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey,&amp;quot; they chimed in unison as I entered the room.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room flashed twice in quick succession.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie and Sarah shot each other worried glances and then a few seconds later there was a low rumbling from outside the window. It was thunder and lightning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuuuck,&amp;quot; said Charlie under his breath, &amp;quot;we hate thunder.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked nervous, but Sarah looked scared. I thought about my grandma back home in East Anglia (or wherever I&amp;#39;m from) and how she was also fearful of thunder and lightning. I&amp;#39;d once nearly had a heart attack as a small boy of around 5 because, whilst staying at her house, she&amp;#39;d camped outside my door during a thunderstorm and scared me shitless as I left my room to go for a pee.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got you,&amp;quot; said Dan to Sarah. Then he looked at Charlie and laughed, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re on your own though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I never asked them what they&amp;#39;d been talking about before I arrived because the conversation shifted to our experiences of storms as children. Sarah remembered camping as a kid one weekend and the experience being completely ruined by a torrential downpour because her over-confident military dad hadn&amp;#39;t checked the weather forecast beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dan told a story about being trapped at school when a thunderstorm at home-time meant most of the students refused to leave the building to brave the rain and the walk home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie remembered it raining in his bedroom due to a leaky roof &amp;#39;flooding&amp;#39; the attic, which then began dripping onto his bed whilst he was laid watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the storm raging outside, the atmosphere in the meditation room was relaxed. We chatted about our childhoods and shared Kit-Kats and a few bottles of coke I&amp;#39;d got. It was a bit like a sleep-over and the bizarre nature of last night&amp;#39;s incident seemed to have been forgotten. Dan and Sarah tried to share a sleeping bag but soon realised that that was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I offered them them mine and told them I&amp;#39;d be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d spent colder nights on exercise and with the a pillow and a beanbag I was more than comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For a while we speculated on what the Grey aliens wanted, if Sarah&amp;#39;s dad knew of their existence and what the Ouija board did when turned on, and what would happen over the next few days. Sarah and I both accepted that we&amp;#39;d probably be in a fair amount of trouble and could only hope that Padre Cliffe would fight our corner as much as possible. I was still dreading seeing Chucky again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a few hours Sarah and Dan fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was about 2200hrs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the next hour or so, Charlie and I chatted about his work at the bar and his relationship with his cousin. He&amp;#39;d not spent loads of time with his dad when he was younger, and when Sarah had moved to Chicksands it meant he could spend time with her and his Uncle Jack - Sgt Maj Jones to me - doing manly things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly the temperature dropped and Christine&amp;#39;s fears of me being cold and uncomfortable became a bit more real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie seemed to notice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;if we unzip the sleeping bag we can use it as a quilt and share.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled his brilliant smile.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was a bit apprehensive at first, but realised I wouldn&amp;#39;t sleep at all tonight if I didn&amp;#39;t accept his offer. We pushed our beanbags together and laid beneath the sleeping bag together. I placed my spare pillow between us to make it a little bit less gay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie fell asleep first and the sound of his breathing actually helped me drift off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I checked my phone - which was still on about 23% after over a day, phone batteries lasted longer back then - it was 2304hrs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I followed Charlie into the land of nod not five minutes later. The storm continued to try and break in through the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At midnight the four of us were awoken by the deafening toll of the church bell...&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I sobbed for need of soap and water to wash my hands of the blood and terror I could smell on them.  When my father finally stopped at a gas station, I scrubbed them until they bled, and chewed them so badly that he made me wear a pair of mittens the rest of the way home.  \\n\\nMy mother could hardly speak.  He put her in bed and left almost immediately afterward.  He was gone for four days.  \\n\\nWhen he came back, he seemed a decade older, and as I met him at the door I could feel the despair coming off him in waves.  For the first time in my life, I was struck by the impression of my father as a weak man.  \\n\\nBefore he even spoke, I felt a resentful thought forming; *You couldn’t stick up for me.  Whatever you’re going to tell me is a half truth, to spare yourself from some sort of embarrassment.  I won’t be surprised when I hear it.*\\n\\n“Our Order is finished,” he said flatly.  “Earth has dissolved it.”\\n\\nMom half-rose from the sofa, then began to cry in pitiful mewls.  “Kill me,” she whimpered.  “I don’t want to live anymore, Mikey, just let me die-”\\n\\n“Hush,” he said.  He looked at me, and then did something that *did* surprise me very much.  “Venus, I’m so sorry.  It wasn’t supposed to go like this.”\\n\\nI stared back at him numbly.\\n\\nHe dropped heavily into the ragged easy chair in front of the TV.  One hand came up as if to cover his eyes, but he merely pressed his thumb and forefinger into them lightly for a moment, then resumed eye contact with me.  “This was your inheritance,” he said.  “We’ve always been a part of the Order in my family.  I...I don’t have anything else to offer you.”\\n\\n“What happened?” I tried to ignore my mother’s sobs.\\n\\n“None of us know.  Naomi must have had some sort of crisis of faith....it happens sometimes, when people see the Goddess.  That was her second time.  She was so young...” He stopped abruptly, wiped his mouth, and went on.  “Earth believes that she had some plan in place to dissolve the Order, or possibly to try to attack the Goddess.  Such things have happened before, but not in our lifetime.  Not even in this century.”\\n\\nI was silent, but I felt a shameful flush creeping through my body, and the urge to wash my hands intensified.\\n\\n“Jupiter was bound to Naomi, the same way that your mother is bound to you.”  He glanced at her, but she was wailing into one of the throw pillows, and wasn’t listening.  “I...I asked her to bind herself to you because she’s not one of the Inborns-”\\n\\n“Inborns?”\\n\\n“Yeah.  Like you and me, and like Jupiter and Saturn.  People who have a place and are named and born into it,” he said.  “Your mom wasn’t, and we’d lost enough of our circle, it wouldn't be right for me to do it.  The woman I named you after died the year before you were born.  If I died as well, there would be as many children in the Order as there were adults, and we were concerned what might happen, so Earth told me I couldn’t bind to you.  It would have to be your mom.”\\n\\nThere it was; the half-closed eyes, the reddened tips of his ears.  That was half a lie.  \\n\\n“So, Naomi had a crisis of faith, which goes against the oaths she took when she initiated formally at sixteen,” he said.  “The Goddess took her father, which was her right...but he took her, too.  And now she’s gone.”\\n\\n“Gone?  How can she-”\\n\\n“She possessed a human, and forced the human to choose between remaining a vessel and suicide.  Naomi chose death, and I can’t really blame her for it.  So the Goddess is freed.”  He sighed deeply and rested his face in his hands.  “Her madness is freed, too.  No point keeping up with rituals meant to keep her contained.”\\n\\nMy blood ran cold at the realization.  Naomi had been the one to kill herself, she’d been *aware*, even as that demonic voice roared out of her throat.  The Goddess had given her the choice.  Even now, I cannot imagine a worse decision to be faced with, or a more awful fate.\\n\\nNor could I ever tell him what her true betrayal had been.  She had not had a crisis of faith.  She - and her parents - had decided to free me from whatever fate the cult held for me.  It had cost Jupiter and Naomi their lives, and Leah Saturn her family.  \\n\\nI know there will be a cost for me, too.  I don’t know what it will be.  But I know that Naomi Saturn is the reason my mother is dead and the reason I am alive. \\n\\nOr at least, she’s the reason I’m alive in the way that I am.  I have a home, a beautiful and intelligent son, a kind and loving husband, and I am clean.  My life has been blessed with things that far outweigh the curses, in my opinion, and I owe that to Naomi.\\n\\nAfter the night of my ninth birthday, my mother’s seizures never stopped.  Despite never having had one before in her life, she was diagnosed with tonic-clonic seizures.  They wouldn’t medicate her for it, though - not with the junkie record she had - and Dad never fought them on it.  We both preferred the seizures over the other changes in her.\\n\\nShe didn’t love either of us anymore, but she truly hated me.  Anything she said to me was twisted with sarcasm and bitterness.  We rarely spoke anyway, as she began to revert to the coping mechanisms she’d used before she met my father.  Our house was littered with poorly hidden syringes and blackened spoons, and stank of cat piss.  It wasn’t just shooting up; she took anything and everything she could get her hands on.  I can’t count the number of times I called 911 after coming home to find her overdosing on various drugs.  \\n\\nI can’t say this drug use was purely selfish escapism on her part.  When she was high, she could talk to me.  She apologized once or twice, even.  It was when she was sober that I was afraid of her.  \\n\\nSometimes she was so overcome with fury, merely at the sight of me or reminders of my existence, that she would fly into a rage and attack me with whatever she could get her hands on.  She threw me down the steps of the fire escape outside our apartment when she found out I cleared out the shower stall.  Though I never confessed my transgression to them, after my first bath, I was obsessed with hygiene.  Dad didn’t like it, but there was no reason to forbid it to me.  \\n\\nOnce she broke my nose over a damp towel I had hung on the rack to dry, because she said it smelled like me.  On the day of my eleventh birthday she tried to kill me (and nearly succeeded) simply because she had remembered the date.\\n\\n“It’s your fault I’m like this,” she told me.  The burnt-rubber smell of PCP hung all around her that night, and her eyes were bugging out of her head.  “You know that, I know it, everyone fucking knows it!  That fucking ritual-”\\n\\n“I didn’t even know that was happening!” I screamed back at her, clutching my arm where she had stabbed me with a kitchen knife.  “You never told me!  How can it be my fault, when I never had a choice?”\\n\\n“You could have fucking died instead,” she said, “Like you were supposed to.  I wish you’d died inside me.  Instead you stole my life, I fucking hate you for it, and I’m going to make it right-”\\n\\nThat was when Dad had gotten home and managed to wrestle the knife from her.  We had to lock her in the bathroom until the cops arrived.  I asked him about it, but he never would explain it to me, and I’ll never know now.\\n\\nHer gradual decline lasted until I was sixteen.  Dad institutionalized her a handful of times, before they finally suggested that we stop picking her up.  He didn’t really resist their gentle coaxing, either - his hands were full enough with me.  She was mostly catatonic by then, unless she saw me, upon which she would only speak in hissed, hateful curses that rarely made any sense. \\n\\nThe loss of her essential spirit had aged him in a terrible way, and although he was more of what I would consider a good father by then, he was certainly miserable.  I know it tortured him to know the woman he loved still lived, but simultaneously didn’t exist.  \\n\\nWhen she finally died (the night of my sixteenth birthday), it was in the aftermath of a terrible seizure.  We’d left her alone to rest in the bedroom.  I don’t know how or when she got a gun, but the blast nearly deafened us.  \\n\\nIt would have been my initiation ceremony that night; had the Order still existed, I could have stepped into the circle, and she would have continued her tortured existence.  Unconfirmed children aren’t punished for their lack of confirmation; the parent who was bound to them always are.  Dad knew it was coming and was prepared, but had either not seen fit to warn me or hadn’t thought of me at all when considering it.  I think the latter is probably more likely.  I don’t know if he could have explained it to me then, anyway, although he did later.\\n\\nNor was I in a stable enough place to understand it.  Madness loomed over me like a guillotine blade.  I heard things where there was silence, I saw things where there was only darkness.  Depression clung to me like invisible fat, making it almost impossible to live as a normal teenage girl.  I didn’t want to die, but sometimes I couldn’t make myself get out of bed and face the world.  Often I didn’t know what was or wasn’t real.  \\n\\nMy father took me out of school and finished my education himself, and I was able to get a GED and start college before I turned eighteen.  Things got worse there - perhaps because of the change, the sudden freedom, and the repressive walls in my brain all coming at odds with one another.  \\n\\nBut at school, I wasn’t alone.\\n\\nI did all the things my few friends recommended.  I saw priests, doctors, and philosophers - I think there was even a fortune-teller or two in there, though I can’t remember what they told me was coming.  Only the doctors were really helpful, anyway.  There is a biological component to this curse; were there a blood test to determine the cause of my insanity, it would have proven genetic, I’m sure.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and several other common personality disorders.  The medicine they gave me works, so I suppose I must really have those things, although I wasn’t born with them and barely fit the guidelines.  I’ve been taking my medication faithfully, but I can feel the insanity in my brain, growing every minute.  There is some sickness inside me, resisting the healing I’ve tried so hard to find.  \\n\\n**February 9th, 2002**\\n\\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I called my father first, even before I told Ryan.  He was silent for a long time, and I was afraid he might have hung up on me.  But he hadn’t.  \\n\\n“Be careful,” he said.  “I don’t know what will happen.”\\n\\n“Will my child be safe?” I twisted the cord again and again as we spoke.  It was a minor tic, something so normal that most wouldn’t notice it, but I couldn’t stop.  \\n\\n“I don’t know.  I think so.  There will be no ceremony...no rites…” But he sounded as unsure as I felt.\\n\\nThere was a long silence between us, and I knew what we were both thinking.  Terminating a pregnancy was more accessible in those days than ever before, and Ryan still didn’t know…\\n\\nBut I knew in my bones that I wouldn’t do it.  The feeling of a life growing inside of me had renewed my long-dying hope in the world.  I thought maybe I had a chance to redeem myself in the eyes of whatever benign gods may exist.  If I could only raise my own child, treat them with kindness and love, teach them to be better…\\n\\n“Your mother wanted to abort you,” Dad said in a near-whisper, as if he knew what I was thinking, and this made the decision for me.  That may be petty and small of me, but it’s also true.  A small part of me hated my mother even (or especially?) after her death, although none of what she did to me was really her fault, and I knew it.  \\n\\n“I’m keeping it,” I said.\\n\\n“Name it after someone better than me,” he said simply, and we hung up after only the briefest of goodbyes.  It didn’t occur to me for months, but he never wished me congratulations or expressed any joy at the idea of becoming a grandfather.  \\n\\nIt was a long, difficult pregnancy, and my father was absent from it.  I rarely heard from him, but never less than during those nine months.  He wouldn’t return my calls, and eventually I stopped making them.  Ryan was the one to call him when I was rushed to the hospital, and I saw the look of pain on his face when he handed the phone back to the nurse’s aid behind the desk.  \\n\\n“He won’t come,” he said.  “I’m sorry, baby.”\\n\\n“Fine,” I said.  “That’s just fine.”\\n\\nOf course it wasn’t, but Ryan’s mother was there, and she was always very kind to me.  When Aiden was born, she lavished him with all the love and joy any mother could ask of her child’s grandmother.  We took him home and I lasted three weeks before I finally had to call Dad.  I was shocked when he picked up.\\n\\n“He’s beautiful,” I said, “His name is Aiden Anthony.”  I slammed the receiver down before he could respond. \\n\\nTo my shock, he called back almost immediately.  As expected, he still refused to see him.  But he did beg us to give him the customary name of a planet.  \\n\\n“Any will do,” he said.  “If this isn’t over...and I’m afraid, so afraid that it might not be.  I’ve had such weird dreams lately, Venus, I don’t know…” \\n\\n“I won’t name him after you,” I said.  \\n\\n“I wouldn’t ask you to,” he said, and his voice was so broken that for a moment my anger was dissolved.  “But for his safety...the name may be protection.  Please.  I’ve given you no reason to trust me, I know, but just this once, please believe me.”\\n\\nAs much as I hated it, I did.  \\n\\nSo we changed his middle name to Jupiter.  But I’ll never call him that.  I’ll never tell him the sick horrors I was made to face as a child.  I swear to whatever may know my most secret heart, I’ll never make him bear witness to those things.  He’ll grow up a healthy and happy child, utterly ignorant to the Order, and to the Goddess.  \\n\\n**November 2nd, 2003**\\n\\nI can feel it starting in him.  I’m so afraid.  \\n\\nAiden is a brilliant child.  He barely cries - that’s his father’s strength and peace of mind in him, I know; it cannot come from me.  He’s kind to other children, obedient to us, and he asks the most beautiful questions.  I love him with everything I have in me.  \\n\\nBut today he began to make a sound he’s never made before, one I’d forgotten I had ever known.  It was that terrible cry, the deep and wordless cry of despair that I heard my own father make in greeting.  I hadn’t known I’d remember it, but when I heard it, it made my blood run cold.  \\n\\nHe made it over and over, even when I asked him to be quiet.  I could see him trying, but he couldn’t stop.  I had to shout at him to make him stop, and he cried as if his little heart had been broken.   \\n\\nI’ve never made him cry before.  \\n\\nWhat if I truly cannot do this?  What if my mother’s selfishness and lack of concern has lived on, through me?  What if the insanity the Goddess cursed me with was passed on through birth?  Is it truly genetic?  I knew there was a chance, and I let this happen anyway.\\n\\nDamn me.  I let this happen.\\n\\n**November 29th, 2003**\\n\\nAll of these damnable rules and I still can’t control myself enough to feel like my child is safe in my arms.\\n\\nI can feel my mother inside me.  She speaks to me sometimes, and has since she died, but never so clearly as when I feed Aiden.  Those moments should be the most peaceful, with him cradled in my arms, his head at my breast, but they’re horrible.  I can feel the sickness passing into him from me, my mother’s insanity and cruelty, my own selfishness and naivety, even the horrible flashes of the Goddess’s laughter ripping from Naomi’s throat.  It’s as if all of those things have been blended together and are pumped through my veins and into the milk, and Aiden drinks it down without any knowing.\\n\\nI know that’s crazy.  I can read over those words and know I’d never let Ryan catch even the slightest whiff of that knowledge.  But it *is* knowledge, perfectly clear and horrible in its simplicity.  I am a poisoned woman, and I have passed this poison on to my own innocent child.\\n\\nMy mother’s whispers tell me that I am washing away like a castle of sand.  With each year, a little bit of myself washes away to further madness.  Eventually the ocean of the Goddess will consume me entirely.\\n\\nPills can only help for so long, she tells me; I am doomed to repeat the past, to surrender my son to the Goddess the way my parents surrendered me.  She reminds me that I belong to the Goddess whose name I no longer dare even to think, for fear that she might hear me, and I cannot escape.  I was sold into a sort of slavery when my parents named me.  There was never a chance for escape.  My fucking father convinced me to sell my son into the same slavery, I think, or why else would I have named him the way I did?  \\n\\nPoor Ryan.  He knows nothing of how twisted and broken his wife really is.  He will never know what I’ve done, what I’ve made him party to.\\n\\nSuicide is the only thinkable option, but even that seems cruel.  Aiden needs me, at least for the next few years.  But how can I continue being his mother, knowing that there is a terrible venom inside me, only waiting for a chance to activate in my son’s veins?\\n\\n**December 4th, 2003**\\n\\nLooking back at my writings in November, I can see the raving of a lunatic just beneath the words.  It’s hard to imagine that I felt suicidal, but those words are inked there in my own hand.  I am lucky Ryan is so patient and kind with me.  \\n\\nI haven’t spoken to Dad in over a year.\\n\\nI’m okay now, I think.  My mother’s voice is gone, and I can sleep soundly at night.  My fingers are beginning to heal; it’s easier to stop myself from chewing them so ragged with the medicine working in me.  I can hug Aiden and feel safe, despite the staggering hugeness of my love for him.\\n\\nMaybe that’s all I’m really scared of.  I’ve lost so much, so often.  It’s hard to love this enormously.  But I think I’m healing.  \\n\\n**September 3rd, 2006**\\n\\nHe’s begun calling himself Jupiter and demands that we do the same.  I know this can be normal for children, and his reasons are sound enough (even if they are based on childish logic).  We *did* give him one of the most popular names for boys his age, and a unique middle name.  It makes sense.  Ryan assures me he’ll grow out of it.\\n\\nI know this is all very logical and sensible, but I’m uneasy.  \\n\\nMaybe it’s silly, but this sense of discomfort has bothered me so badly in the past few days that I had to call Dad.  It’s the first time we’ve really talked since Aiden was born.  Oh, we send each other Christmas and birthday cards, and he comes to our house for a plate or two on Thanksgiving (after our son is tucked into bed).  Ryan’s even gone to a couple of hockey games with him.  But we haven’t spoken to each other by phone, or with anything resembling intimacy, in years.  I was surprised he picked up the phone. \\n\\nI told him about everything - the verbal tics and apparent signs of OCD, the sudden demands to be called by his middle name, my own breakdown several years ago.  He told me I was being a good mom, feeling overprotective, all the normal comforting things that Ryan’s already said to me time and time again, but I could hear in his voice that he didn’t believe me.\\n\\n“I didn’t have OCD until I was nine,” I said.  “If you know something about this, you need to tell me.  You owe me that much, don’t you?”\\n\\n“I owe you the world,” he said, his voice weary.  It alarmed me to realize he was crying.  “But it’s too late for that.  Wherever these mental illnesses came from, honey, they’re a part of your genetic code now.  Maybe that’s all they ever were.”\\n\\nHe could be right. I don’t know, and that’s what torments me.  Is it all a coincidence?\\n\\nMy husband is so good about all of this.  He’s read every parenting book out there that even touches on mental illness in children, and he’s showered Aiden in all the love a kid could ask for.  I asked him once, during one of my difficult spells, if he would hate me if Aiden grew up to be as crazy as I am.\\n\\n“I love you,” Ryan told me, and there’s no doubt I believe him.  “I love him.  What is there to hate you for?  You gave me this awesome kid, and if he’s got some toys in the attic, so what?  We’ll figure it out, and we’ll raise him right so that when he’s grown up, he can figure things out for himself. He’ll be okay.  He’s got too much going for him not to be.”\\n\\nBless him.  I hope he’s right.\\n\\nI’ll make the best of things.  Sure, I can’t call him Jupiter; the memory of that great bear of a man, full of kindness and goodness, lying dead on the ground because of his choice to save *me*; it’s all too fresh in my mind.  All these years later, I can’t speak his name without thinking of him.  \\n\\nSo what?  I’ll make up a nickname out of it, something Aiden will accept, and it will work out.\\n\\n**April 17th, 2008**\\n\\nJup has every mental illness I have.  There’s no doubt of it.  The bipolar disorder is still mostly dormant, but the OCD has taken over.  He has rules of his own.  \\n\\nIt’s frightening to see them growing in him.  I didn’t expect it to be so scary; after all, how could I be afraid of someone who suffers the same things that I do?  But it’s not the same.  Not at all.\\n\\nWe share some of the same compulsions, but he’s got his own, too.  He bites his nails, but not like I do.  When things are wrong - not normal-wrong, but OCD-wrong - he doesn’t bite at his fingers like I do.  Instead, he screams.  He shrieks like he’s just been scared out of his mind, or like his heart is breaking, and he won’t stop until the wrong has been righted.  I swear I can hear the desperate screams of my mother on my oath night, somewhere in the depths of his young voice.  \\n\\nHe told me the other day that he wanted to die.  \\n\\nI didn’t even know what to say.  I tried to tell him the truth.  That’s what all the parenting books and therapists have advised me to do.  But it’s hard to tell your child that it’s okay to want to kill yourself, or to explain that it’s not about life and death but about control.  It feels dangerously close to giving him permission.  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing - I never know that anymore, it seems.\\n\\nI hate myself.  I hate that I could have sentenced him to a lifetime of this.  I hate that I am too afraid and too ashamed to tell Ryan the truth.  I hate that I know I cannot ever tell my son why he is the way that he is.  I hate that I don’t know for sure; because if I did, I *would* tell him.  Not everything, never the horrors; but I could tell him enough that he could feel righteous anger, that he could lay blame where it truly belongs.  \\n\\nWe’re doing the best we can for him.  I’m trying to hide my fears.  Ryan tells me every day how lucky Jup is, to have me around, to show him the ropes.  \\n\\nIf he only knew.  \\n\\n**March 29th, 2011**\\n\\nThe pills don’t work anymore.  They can numb, they can soften, but they can no longer silence. \\n\\nI can’t stand the taste of Tic-Tacs.  \\n\\nJup is perfect.  He’s growing into a young man, and I can feel myself withering with each day he grows stronger.  Do all parents feel like this, or just the damned ones?  Is it just the curse at work within me?  \\n\\nMy mother’s voice is so loud these days.  It’s hard to keep her out of my head.  I don’t know if it’s my mother, really; I was so young when she died, and it’s been so long.  Maybe the voice is only the ragged, belching laughter of the Goddess.  I can’t remember what it sounds like, afterwards.  There is only the imprint of her words in my mind.\\n\\nShe tells me there is no hope, that the Goddess will take me and then she’ll take Jup.  There’s nothing I can do.  All my love for him cannot stop it.  \\n\\nI want to die.  \\n\\n**September 4th, 2016**\\n\\nI spoke to Dad for the first time tonight since eight years ago.  \\n\\nI’ve told him everything, all the things I’ve written in the past month.  Sent them\\n\\nlast week, he must have just got them today.  I’ll send the rest tonight   \\n\\nThe predictions and visions have all come true.  Every last one of them.  \\n\\nIt was such a good day.  \\n\\nHe sounded older, so much older than his sixty years, and I know why now.  Dad has not been as complacent as I thought.  \\n\\nThe Order is not dead.  There is to be no silence.  No peace.\\n\\nHe told me \\n\\nEVERYTHING\\n\\nI wish he hadn’t.  There is no hope.  There is nothing.  I have nothing but pills.\\n\\nNext year, Jup will turn sixteen, and the Goddess will take him.  \\n\\nThe illness in him is already strong, despite the meds, and although he exhibits none of the symptoms of depression, I can smell it on him.  I can feel it in the air around him.  I know she’s coming for him, and I am utterly powerless.\\n\\nThere is one thing I can do.  I can refuse to play the game. \\n\\nit was so good, and now all of that is gone \\n\\nLast night I dreamed of Naomi Saturn.  I had forgotten what she looked like.  \\n\\nHer death played again in bright Technicolor clarity, and I am tortured with the memories, the not-knowing, the awareness, \\n\\nthe incompleteness of it all!\\n\\nI choose this now, as Naomi Saturn chose for me.  I’ll \\n\\nend it\\n\\nforgive me, Ryan\\n\\nforgive me, Jup\\n\\nyou both deserved better\\n\\n*Editor’s notes:*\\n\\n*I have tried to transcribe this entry perfectly, but it’s almost illegible.  The words are not neatly written along lines, as in all other entries, nor is the paper the same.  She apparently wrote it on the back of the front cover of a copy of Stephen King’s novel, “The Green Mile”.  It’s badly creased and the ink is smeared in places.  I have tried to copy it faithfully, but I promise that any mistakes which may be present were unintentional.*\\n\\n*Her handwriting quality seems to have worsened with increasing mental distress, and the letters uneven and poorly formed.  Words trail off seemingly at random down the page, or look like they were written with a child’s hand.  It is possible that this is because she was already feeling the effects of whatever pills she took.  There’s no perfect way to put that in text that I’ve found, but I tried to copy the spacing as close to exactly as possible.*\\n\\n*The pages of premonitions and visions she mentioned are missing.  The only pieces delivered to me are the ones I’ve posted above.*  \\n\\n*I feel it’s important to include the only details I have which may give a clue to the author’s end.  While the papers were delivered to me in a plain white file box, bound in a single-subject notebook from which many pages had obviously been hastily torn, there was a manilla envelope at the bottom containing the last entry.  The mailing address was hand-written in the same childlike writing.  It was sent to a PO box in New York, which is no longer in use, and the return address was torn off.  This envelope was postmarked the same date as the suicide note.*\\n\\n*It’s possible that the author mailed off both the notebook and the note at the same time, but I think it’s more likely that she mailed the notebook prior to the last date, as she wrote, then tossed the suicide note into an envelope* \\n\\n*Again, I urge the anonymous donor to please contact me, either via message here, or at the same address where your delivery was made, and I will provide you with my phone number.  I need to speak to you, as things have begun happening in my home that I will not put into text.  I won’t tell anyone else unless you tell me to do so, and I will not contact authorities of any type.*  \\n\\n*Please.*\",\n",

I sobbed for need of soap and water to wash my hands of the blood and terror I could smell on them.  When my father finally stopped at a gas station, I scrubbed them until they bled, and chewed them so badly that he made me wear a pair of mittens the rest of the way home.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother could hardly speak.  He put her in bed and left almost immediately afterward.  He was gone for four days.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When he came back, he seemed a decade older, and as I met him at the door I could feel the despair coming off him in waves.  For the first time in my life, I was struck by the impression of my father as a weak man.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before he even spoke, I felt a resentful thought forming; &lt;em&gt;You couldn’t stick up for me.  Whatever you’re going to tell me is a half truth, to spare yourself from some sort of embarrassment.  I won’t be surprised when I hear it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Our Order is finished,” he said flatly.  “Earth has dissolved it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mom half-rose from the sofa, then began to cry in pitiful mewls.  “Kill me,” she whimpered.  “I don’t want to live anymore, Mikey, just let me die-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hush,” he said.  He looked at me, and then did something that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; surprise me very much.  “Venus, I’m so sorry.  It wasn’t supposed to go like this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stared back at him numbly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He dropped heavily into the ragged easy chair in front of the TV.  One hand came up as if to cover his eyes, but he merely pressed his thumb and forefinger into them lightly for a moment, then resumed eye contact with me.  “This was your inheritance,” he said.  “We’ve always been a part of the Order in my family.  I...I don’t have anything else to offer you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What happened?” I tried to ignore my mother’s sobs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“None of us know.  Naomi must have had some sort of crisis of faith....it happens sometimes, when people see the Goddess.  That was her second time.  She was so young...” He stopped abruptly, wiped his mouth, and went on.  “Earth believes that she had some plan in place to dissolve the Order, or possibly to try to attack the Goddess.  Such things have happened before, but not in our lifetime.  Not even in this century.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was silent, but I felt a shameful flush creeping through my body, and the urge to wash my hands intensified.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jupiter was bound to Naomi, the same way that your mother is bound to you.”  He glanced at her, but she was wailing into one of the throw pillows, and wasn’t listening.  “I...I asked her to bind herself to you because she’s not one of the Inborns-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Inborns?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.  Like you and me, and like Jupiter and Saturn.  People who have a place and are named and born into it,” he said.  “Your mom wasn’t, and we’d lost enough of our circle, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be right for me to do it.  The woman I named you after died the year before you were born.  If I died as well, there would be as many children in the Order as there were adults, and we were concerned what might happen, so Earth told me I couldn’t bind to you.  It would have to be your mom.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There it was; the half-closed eyes, the reddened tips of his ears.  That was half a lie.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So, Naomi had a crisis of faith, which goes against the oaths she took when she initiated formally at sixteen,” he said.  “The Goddess took her father, which was her right...but he took her, too.  And now she’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Gone?  How can she-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She possessed a human, and forced the human to choose between remaining a vessel and suicide.  Naomi chose death, and I can’t really blame her for it.  So the Goddess is freed.”  He sighed deeply and rested his face in his hands.  “Her madness is freed, too.  No point keeping up with rituals meant to keep her contained.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My blood ran cold at the realization.  Naomi had been the one to kill herself, she’d been &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt;, even as that demonic voice roared out of her throat.  The Goddess had given her the choice.  Even now, I cannot imagine a worse decision to be faced with, or a more awful fate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nor could I ever tell him what her true betrayal had been.  She had not had a crisis of faith.  She - and her parents - had decided to free me from whatever fate the cult held for me.  It had cost Jupiter and Naomi their lives, and Leah Saturn her family.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know there will be a cost for me, too.  I don’t know what it will be.  But I know that Naomi Saturn is the reason my mother is dead and the reason I am alive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least, she’s the reason I’m alive in the way that I am.  I have a home, a beautiful and intelligent son, a kind and loving husband, and I am clean.  My life has been blessed with things that far outweigh the curses, in my opinion, and I owe that to Naomi.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After the night of my ninth birthday, my mother’s seizures never stopped.  Despite never having had one before in her life, she was diagnosed with tonic-clonic seizures.  They wouldn’t medicate her for it, though - not with the junkie record she had - and Dad never fought them on it.  We both preferred the seizures over the other changes in her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She didn’t love either of us anymore, but she truly hated me.  Anything she said to me was twisted with sarcasm and bitterness.  We rarely spoke anyway, as she began to revert to the coping mechanisms she’d used before she met my father.  Our house was littered with poorly hidden syringes and blackened spoons, and stank of cat piss.  It wasn’t just shooting up; she took anything and everything she could get her hands on.  I can’t count the number of times I called 911 after coming home to find her overdosing on various drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t say this drug use was purely selfish escapism on her part.  When she was high, she could talk to me.  She apologized once or twice, even.  It was when she was sober that I was afraid of her.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she was so overcome with fury, merely at the sight of me or reminders of my existence, that she would fly into a rage and attack me with whatever she could get her hands on.  She threw me down the steps of the fire escape outside our apartment when she found out I cleared out the shower stall.  Though I never confessed my transgression to them, after my first bath, I was obsessed with hygiene.  Dad didn’t like it, but there was no reason to forbid it to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once she broke my nose over a damp towel I had hung on the rack to dry, because she said it smelled like me.  On the day of my eleventh birthday she tried to kill me (and nearly succeeded) simply because she had remembered the date.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s your fault I’m like this,” she told me.  The burnt-rubber smell of PCP hung all around her that night, and her eyes were bugging out of her head.  “You know that, I know it, everyone fucking knows it!  That fucking ritual-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t even know that was happening!” I screamed back at her, clutching my arm where she had stabbed me with a kitchen knife.  “You never told me!  How can it be my fault, when I never had a choice?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You could have fucking died instead,” she said, “Like you were supposed to.  I wish you’d died inside me.  Instead you stole my life, I fucking hate you for it, and I’m going to make it right-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was when Dad had gotten home and managed to wrestle the knife from her.  We had to lock her in the bathroom until the cops arrived.  I asked him about it, but he never would explain it to me, and I’ll never know now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her gradual decline lasted until I was sixteen.  Dad institutionalized her a handful of times, before they finally suggested that we stop picking her up.  He didn’t really resist their gentle coaxing, either - his hands were full enough with me.  She was mostly catatonic by then, unless she saw me, upon which she would only speak in hissed, hateful curses that rarely made any sense. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The loss of her essential spirit had aged him in a terrible way, and although he was more of what I would consider a good father by then, he was certainly miserable.  I know it tortured him to know the woman he loved still lived, but simultaneously didn’t exist.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When she finally died (the night of my sixteenth birthday), it was in the aftermath of a terrible seizure.  We’d left her alone to rest in the bedroom.  I don’t know how or when she got a gun, but the blast nearly deafened us.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It would have been my initiation ceremony that night; had the Order still existed, I could have stepped into the circle, and she would have continued her tortured existence.  Unconfirmed children aren’t punished for their lack of confirmation; the parent who was bound to them always are.  Dad knew it was coming and was prepared, but had either not seen fit to warn me or hadn’t thought of me at all when considering it.  I think the latter is probably more likely.  I don’t know if he could have explained it to me then, anyway, although he did later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nor was I in a stable enough place to understand it.  Madness loomed over me like a guillotine blade.  I heard things where there was silence, I saw things where there was only darkness.  Depression clung to me like invisible fat, making it almost impossible to live as a normal teenage girl.  I didn’t want to die, but sometimes I couldn’t make myself get out of bed and face the world.  Often I didn’t know what was or wasn’t real.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My father took me out of school and finished my education himself, and I was able to get a GED and start college before I turned eighteen.  Things got worse there - perhaps because of the change, the sudden freedom, and the repressive walls in my brain all coming at odds with one another.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But at school, I wasn’t alone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did all the things my few friends recommended.  I saw priests, doctors, and philosophers - I think there was even a fortune-teller or two in there, though I can’t remember what they told me was coming.  Only the doctors were really helpful, anyway.  There is a biological component to this curse; were there a blood test to determine the cause of my insanity, it would have proven genetic, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and several other common personality disorders.  The medicine they gave me works, so I suppose I must really have those things, although I wasn’t born with them and barely fit the guidelines.  I’ve been taking my medication faithfully, but I can feel the insanity in my brain, growing every minute.  There is some sickness inside me, resisting the healing I’ve tried so hard to find.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 9th, 2002&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was pregnant, I called my father first, even before I told Ryan.  He was silent for a long time, and I was afraid he might have hung up on me.  But he hadn’t.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Be careful,” he said.  “I don’t know what will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Will my child be safe?” I twisted the cord again and again as we spoke.  It was a minor tic, something so normal that most wouldn’t notice it, but I couldn’t stop.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.  I think so.  There will be no ceremony...no rites…” But he sounded as unsure as I felt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a long silence between us, and I knew what we were both thinking.  Terminating a pregnancy was more accessible in those days than ever before, and Ryan still didn’t know…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I knew in my bones that I wouldn’t do it.  The feeling of a life growing inside of me had renewed my long-dying hope in the world.  I thought maybe I had a chance to redeem myself in the eyes of whatever benign gods may exist.  If I could only raise my own child, treat them with kindness and love, teach them to be better…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your mother wanted to abort you,” Dad said in a near-whisper, as if he knew what I was thinking, and this made the decision for me.  That may be petty and small of me, but it’s also true.  A small part of me hated my mother even (or especially?) after her death, although none of what she did to me was really her fault, and I knew it.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m keeping it,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Name it after someone better than me,” he said simply, and we hung up after only the briefest of goodbyes.  It didn’t occur to me for months, but he never wished me congratulations or expressed any joy at the idea of becoming a grandfather.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was a long, difficult pregnancy, and my father was absent from it.  I rarely heard from him, but never less than during those nine months.  He wouldn’t return my calls, and eventually I stopped making them.  Ryan was the one to call him when I was rushed to the hospital, and I saw the look of pain on his face when he handed the phone back to the nurse’s aid behind the desk.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He won’t come,” he said.  “I’m sorry, baby.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” I said.  “That’s just fine.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it wasn’t, but Ryan’s mother was there, and she was always very kind to me.  When Aiden was born, she lavished him with all the love and joy any mother could ask of her child’s grandmother.  We took him home and I lasted three weeks before I finally had to call Dad.  I was shocked when he picked up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He’s beautiful,” I said, “His name is Aiden Anthony.”  I slammed the receiver down before he could respond. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To my shock, he called back almost immediately.  As expected, he still refused to see him.  But he did beg us to give him the customary name of a planet.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Any will do,” he said.  “If this isn’t over...and I’m afraid, so afraid that it might not be.  I’ve had such weird dreams lately, Venus, I don’t know…” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I won’t name him after you,” I said.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t ask you to,” he said, and his voice was so broken that for a moment my anger was dissolved.  “But for his safety...the name may be protection.  Please.  I’ve given you no reason to trust me, I know, but just this once, please believe me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As much as I hated it, I did.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So we changed his middle name to Jupiter.  But I’ll never call him that.  I’ll never tell him the sick horrors I was made to face as a child.  I swear to whatever may know my most secret heart, I’ll never make him bear witness to those things.  He’ll grow up a healthy and happy child, utterly ignorant to the Order, and to the Goddess.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2nd, 2003&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can feel it starting in him.  I’m so afraid.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Aiden is a brilliant child.  He barely cries - that’s his father’s strength and peace of mind in him, I know; it cannot come from me.  He’s kind to other children, obedient to us, and he asks the most beautiful questions.  I love him with everything I have in me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But today he began to make a sound he’s never made before, one I’d forgotten I had ever known.  It was that terrible cry, the deep and wordless cry of despair that I heard my own father make in greeting.  I hadn’t known I’d remember it, but when I heard it, it made my blood run cold.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He made it over and over, even when I asked him to be quiet.  I could see him trying, but he couldn’t stop.  I had to shout at him to make him stop, and he cried as if his little heart had been broken.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never made him cry before.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What if I truly cannot do this?  What if my mother’s selfishness and lack of concern has lived on, through me?  What if the insanity the Goddess cursed me with was passed on through birth?  Is it truly genetic?  I knew there was a chance, and I let this happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Damn me.  I let this happen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 29th, 2003&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All of these damnable rules and I still can’t control myself enough to feel like my child is safe in my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can feel my mother inside me.  She speaks to me sometimes, and has since she died, but never so clearly as when I feed Aiden.  Those moments should be the most peaceful, with him cradled in my arms, his head at my breast, but they’re horrible.  I can feel the sickness passing into him from me, my mother’s insanity and cruelty, my own selfishness and naivety, even the horrible flashes of the Goddess’s laughter ripping from Naomi’s throat.  It’s as if all of those things have been blended together and are pumped through my veins and into the milk, and Aiden drinks it down without any knowing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know that’s crazy.  I can read over those words and know I’d never let Ryan catch even the slightest whiff of that knowledge.  But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, perfectly clear and horrible in its simplicity.  I am a poisoned woman, and I have passed this poison on to my own innocent child.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother’s whispers tell me that I am washing away like a castle of sand.  With each year, a little bit of myself washes away to further madness.  Eventually the ocean of the Goddess will consume me entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pills can only help for so long, she tells me; I am doomed to repeat the past, to surrender my son to the Goddess the way my parents surrendered me.  She reminds me that I belong to the Goddess whose name I no longer dare even to think, for fear that she might hear me, and I cannot escape.  I was sold into a sort of slavery when my parents named me.  There was never a chance for escape.  My fucking father convinced me to sell my son into the same slavery, I think, or why else would I have named him the way I did?  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Ryan.  He knows nothing of how twisted and broken his wife really is.  He will never know what I’ve done, what I’ve made him party to.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suicide is the only thinkable option, but even that seems cruel.  Aiden needs me, at least for the next few years.  But how can I continue being his mother, knowing that there is a terrible venom inside me, only waiting for a chance to activate in my son’s veins?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 4th, 2003&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my writings in November, I can see the raving of a lunatic just beneath the words.  It’s hard to imagine that I felt suicidal, but those words are inked there in my own hand.  I am lucky Ryan is so patient and kind with me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t spoken to Dad in over a year.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m okay now, I think.  My mother’s voice is gone, and I can sleep soundly at night.  My fingers are beginning to heal; it’s easier to stop myself from chewing them so ragged with the medicine working in me.  I can hug Aiden and feel safe, despite the staggering hugeness of my love for him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s all I’m really scared of.  I’ve lost so much, so often.  It’s hard to love this enormously.  But I think I’m healing.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 3rd, 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He’s begun calling himself Jupiter and demands that we do the same.  I know this can be normal for children, and his reasons are sound enough (even if they are based on childish logic).  We &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; give him one of the most popular names for boys his age, and a unique middle name.  It makes sense.  Ryan assures me he’ll grow out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is all very logical and sensible, but I’m uneasy.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s silly, but this sense of discomfort has bothered me so badly in the past few days that I had to call Dad.  It’s the first time we’ve really talked since Aiden was born.  Oh, we send each other Christmas and birthday cards, and he comes to our house for a plate or two on Thanksgiving (after our son is tucked into bed).  Ryan’s even gone to a couple of hockey games with him.  But we haven’t spoken to each other by phone, or with anything resembling intimacy, in years.  I was surprised he picked up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told him about everything - the verbal tics and apparent signs of OCD, the sudden demands to be called by his middle name, my own breakdown several years ago.  He told me I was being a good mom, feeling overprotective, all the normal comforting things that Ryan’s already said to me time and time again, but I could hear in his voice that he didn’t believe me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have OCD until I was nine,” I said.  “If you know something about this, you need to tell me.  You owe me that much, don’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I owe you the world,” he said, his voice weary.  It alarmed me to realize he was crying.  “But it’s too late for that.  Wherever these mental illnesses came from, honey, they’re a part of your genetic code now.  Maybe that’s all they ever were.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He could be right. I don’t know, and that’s what torments me.  Is it all a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is so good about all of this.  He’s read every parenting book out there that even touches on mental illness in children, and he’s showered Aiden in all the love a kid could ask for.  I asked him once, during one of my difficult spells, if he would hate me if Aiden grew up to be as crazy as I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I love you,” Ryan told me, and there’s no doubt I believe him.  “I love him.  What is there to hate you for?  You gave me this awesome kid, and if he’s got some toys in the attic, so what?  We’ll figure it out, and we’ll raise him right so that when he’s grown up, he can figure things out for himself. He’ll be okay.  He’s got too much going for him not to be.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bless him.  I hope he’s right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll make the best of things.  Sure, I can’t call him Jupiter; the memory of that great bear of a man, full of kindness and goodness, lying dead on the ground because of his choice to save &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;; it’s all too fresh in my mind.  All these years later, I can’t speak his name without thinking of him.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So what?  I’ll make up a nickname out of it, something Aiden will accept, and it will work out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 17th, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jup has every mental illness I have.  There’s no doubt of it.  The bipolar disorder is still mostly dormant, but the OCD has taken over.  He has rules of his own.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s frightening to see them growing in him.  I didn’t expect it to be so scary; after all, how could I be afraid of someone who suffers the same things that I do?  But it’s not the same.  Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We share some of the same compulsions, but he’s got his own, too.  He bites his nails, but not like I do.  When things are wrong - not normal-wrong, but OCD-wrong - he doesn’t bite at his fingers like I do.  Instead, he screams.  He shrieks like he’s just been scared out of his mind, or like his heart is breaking, and he won’t stop until the wrong has been righted.  I swear I can hear the desperate screams of my mother on my oath night, somewhere in the depths of his young voice.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He told me the other day that he wanted to die.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even know what to say.  I tried to tell him the truth.  That’s what all the parenting books and therapists have advised me to do.  But it’s hard to tell your child that it’s okay to want to kill yourself, or to explain that it’s not about life and death but about control.  It feels dangerously close to giving him permission.  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing - I never know that anymore, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate myself.  I hate that I could have sentenced him to a lifetime of this.  I hate that I am too afraid and too ashamed to tell Ryan the truth.  I hate that I know I cannot ever tell my son why he is the way that he is.  I hate that I don’t know for sure; because if I did, I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; tell him.  Not everything, never the horrors; but I could tell him enough that he could feel righteous anger, that he could lay blame where it truly belongs.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We’re doing the best we can for him.  I’m trying to hide my fears.  Ryan tells me every day how lucky Jup is, to have me around, to show him the ropes.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If he only knew.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 29th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The pills don’t work anymore.  They can numb, they can soften, but they can no longer silence. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand the taste of Tic-Tacs.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jup is perfect.  He’s growing into a young man, and I can feel myself withering with each day he grows stronger.  Do all parents feel like this, or just the damned ones?  Is it just the curse at work within me?  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother’s voice is so loud these days.  It’s hard to keep her out of my head.  I don’t know if it’s my mother, really; I was so young when she died, and it’s been so long.  Maybe the voice is only the ragged, belching laughter of the Goddess.  I can’t remember what it sounds like, afterwards.  There is only the imprint of her words in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She tells me there is no hope, that the Goddess will take me and then she’ll take Jup.  There’s nothing I can do.  All my love for him cannot stop it.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to die.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 4th, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Dad for the first time tonight since eight years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve told him everything, all the things I’ve written in the past month.  Sent them&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;last week, he must have just got them today.  I’ll send the rest tonight   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The predictions and visions have all come true.  Every last one of them.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was such a good day.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sounded older, so much older than his sixty years, and I know why now.  Dad has not been as complacent as I thought.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Order is not dead.  There is to be no silence.  No peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He told me &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wish he hadn’t.  There is no hope.  There is nothing.  I have nothing but pills.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next year, Jup will turn sixteen, and the Goddess will take him.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The illness in him is already strong, despite the meds, and although he exhibits none of the symptoms of depression, I can smell it on him.  I can feel it in the air around him.  I know she’s coming for him, and I am utterly powerless.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There is one thing I can do.  I can refuse to play the game. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;it was so good, and now all of that is gone &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I dreamed of Naomi Saturn.  I had forgotten what she looked like.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her death played again in bright Technicolor clarity, and I am tortured with the memories, the not-knowing, the awareness, &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;the incompleteness of it all!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I choose this now, as Naomi Saturn chose for me.  I’ll &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;end it&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;forgive me, Ryan&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;forgive me, Jup&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;you both deserved better&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have tried to transcribe this entry perfectly, but it’s almost illegible.  The words are not neatly written along lines, as in all other entries, nor is the paper the same.  She apparently wrote it on the back of the front cover of a copy of Stephen King’s novel, “The Green Mile”.  It’s badly creased and the ink is smeared in places.  I have tried to copy it faithfully, but I promise that any mistakes which may be present were unintentional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her handwriting quality seems to have worsened with increasing mental distress, and the letters uneven and poorly formed.  Words trail off seemingly at random down the page, or look like they were written with a child’s hand.  It is possible that this is because she was already feeling the effects of whatever pills she took.  There’s no perfect way to put that in text that I’ve found, but I tried to copy the spacing as close to exactly as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pages of premonitions and visions she mentioned are missing.  The only pieces delivered to me are the ones I’ve posted above.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I feel it’s important to include the only details I have which may give a clue to the author’s end.  While the papers were delivered to me in a plain white file box, bound in a single-subject notebook from which many pages had obviously been hastily torn, there was a manilla envelope at the bottom containing the last entry.  The mailing address was hand-written in the same childlike writing.  It was sent to a PO box in New York, which is no longer in use, and the return address was torn off.  This envelope was postmarked the same date as the suicide note.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s possible that the author mailed off both the notebook and the note at the same time, but I think it’s more likely that she mailed the notebook prior to the last date, as she wrote, then tossed the suicide note into an envelope&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again, I urge the anonymous donor to please contact me, either via message here, or at the same address where your delivery was made, and I will provide you with my phone number.  I need to speak to you, as things have begun happening in my home that I will not put into text.  I won’t tell anyone else unless you tell me to do so, and I will not contact authorities of any type.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hello, Reddit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a problem. One I know I won’t be able to fix.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m all out of options. I just need somewhere to vent a little bit, before it’s all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nI live on a small chunk of property in the middle of Nebraska, with my wife Linda and our two kids, Noah and Carly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a peaceful life. Linda has a garden she takes care of with the kids. A few months back, I bought a few sheep. Linda likes to make clothing out of the wool and sell them to anyone who’s willing to buy. The kids like them as pets, of course. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur property sits right beside a large forest. It really was massive. I’d never felt the need to explore it, as it wasn’t our property in the first place. The kids, on the other hand, constantly needed to be reminded. I’d often let them play around the edge of the woods, but the second any of them got too far in, I would yell and call them back. I was never serious, of course. It became somewhat of a game for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday morning was no different than any other. I woke up early every day to check on the sheep and take our dog Bailey outside. She’s a great dog. She stays right beside me and doesn’t bark at the sheep. That’s all I could ask for, really.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the one who spent most of my free time out on the property. I knew it like the back of my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI approached the sheep pen, the ewes looking up at me as I approached. They began to bleat as I entered the shed that sat beside their home, lifting the heavy bag of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dumped the food into the trough, watching as the sheep began to flock towards their meal. There were four sheep, one for each of us. I named mine Dolly, of course. My wife named hers Beth. She says she just liked the name. Noah named his Rocket, which I had told him was an odd name for a girl sheep. He didn’t seem to care. Naturally, Carly named hers Fluffy. I don’t think I need to explain that one to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI set down the bag of food, wiping the sweat from my forehead. As I knelt to pick the bag back up, something odd in the distance caught my eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wasn’t completely sure, but it was almost as if there were more trees in the forest than there had been the previous day. I began to walk towards the woods, Bailey close behind me. As I approached, the change became obvious. Every tree, every rock, every bump on the ground was a landmark to me. Hundreds of trees had somehow grown on my property overnight. The forest’s new edge had moved forward nearly ten feet, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nBailey sniffed at one of the trees as I approached the forest, placing my hand against the bark. It was solid, a strong tree. It felt as if it had been here for decades. \\r\\n\\r\\nI looked back to Bailey who looked impatient to get back to the house. I didn’t blame her. Something felt off.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to the house, kissing my wife on the cheek as I found her in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, have you noticed anything different?” I asked, leaning on the countertop.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked over her shoulder, the coffee machine humming. “Did you get taller?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI sighed. “No, Linda. I mean *outside.*”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked out the window, frowning. “I don’t see anything out of place, no. Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI shrugged, pouring myself a glass of water from the faucet. “Oh, it’s nothing. I just thought the trees looked closer than they usually do, that’s all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife looked back outside, chuckling. “They look the same to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded, downing my drink. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right,” I said, setting my glass down in the sink.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Trees don’t just pop up out of nowhere, Frank,” she said, smiling as I headed back to our bedroom. I couldn’t waste anymore time, or I’d be late for work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy kids hopped around at my feet as I walked to my truck, my eyes glued to the forest. I couldn’t help but feel as if they had moved even closer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat entire day, I couldn’t stop thinking about the woods behind my house. No matter what I did, I just *couldn’t stop.*\\r\\n\\r\\nMy company had been working on building a home for the past few weeks now. I stood by my truck, sipping from my water bottle as I stared at my phone. It was nearly six o’clock now.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, if you’re just going to stare at your phone, you may as well just leave,” my friend Chuck said, smirking at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure?” I said, feeling stupid for getting caught slacking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re alright, Frank,” he said, climbing down from a ladder. “We’ll clean up here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry, Chuck,” I said, stepping around to the driver's seat. “Linda’s making her chicken tonight. I can’t miss it,” I said, lying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hey, say hello to Linda for me, will you?” he said. “Haven’t seen your family in a while.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded. “Sure man, you got it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gripped the steering wheel hard as I drove home, anxious for whatever reason. I felt like I was losing my mind. How could the trees be *moving?*\\r\\n\\r\\nI parked my car in the driveway, heading straight for the back of the house. I entered my shed, pulling out a stake from the top shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was setting by the time I reached the forest. I looked out into the trees, sighing. I hammered the stake into the ground right between the two closest trees to my property. I’d see just how crazy I was in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was nice, but it was no chicken, that’s for sure. The next morning, I took Bailey outside, heading straight for the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked directly to where I’d set the stake, my eyes searching the ground. It was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing was, though, it *wasn’t* gone. I found it shortly after, about fifteen feet into the forest. I was stunned. Was someone playing a trick on me? Either someone had moved my stake, or another several hundred trees had appeared on my property.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I removed my stake from the ground, I could hear Bailey beginning to growl behind me. I looked to my dog, who was staring out into the woods, her teeth bared. I followed her line of sight, finding nothing but trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked out of the woods, calling for Bailey to follow me. I had to be losing my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to explain the situation to Linda, but she wouldn’t believe me, obviously.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt work that day, we were working extra hard. We always tended to do that on the last day of the work week.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, Chuck,” I said, rubbing my forehead. “I think I may be stressing too much.”\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck grunted, setting a piece of wood down beside the house. “And why is that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI shrugged, stepping aside to start my break. “Oh, you know. Just stupid things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Like *what,* Frank?” Chuck said, following me. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nI scratched the back of my neck, sighing. “Well, mostly, I keep thinking that the trees behind my house are getting closer. Shit like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank scoffed. “Really?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded. “Yeah, weird, right?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrank shook his head. “No, I mean, I thought the same thing. About my house, though, not yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI frowned. “Wait, what?”\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck smiled. “Yeah, I was on the edge of my property, and I thought I saw an extra tree or two,” he said, lighting a cigarette. “It’s weird we did the same thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI grunted. “Yeah, well, I’ve seen a few more than that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, how many?” Chuck said, placing the cigarette in between his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The trees have moved up almost twenty-five feet, now,” I said, suddenly embarrassed. “Or, I least I *think* they have.”\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck squinted, nodding slowly as he inhaled. We sat in silence as he held in the smoke, finally exhaling. “Yeah, you *might* be stressed, Frank.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You two going to get back to work any time soon?” our friend Jim called from the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We just got on break, shithead,” Chuck replied, rolling his eyes at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made great progress that day. We’d probably be finished with the house by the end of the next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way home, I stopped at the local Chinese food place in town to pick up dinner. It wasn’t a Friday night without our Chinese takeout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owners had my order ready for when I entered the restaurant. I paid and headed home, choosing to push aside any thoughts of the forest. The weekend was for relaxation, after all. \\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was delicious, as always. Every Friday night, Linda and I would watch our favorite show on the television, while Noah and Carly would spend time playing together. Tonight, they were outside in the backyard with Bailey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lived in the middle of nowhere. I never feared letting my children play outside at night. I’d done it as a child, myself. The only thing they needed to fear was the rare wild animal, and that only included the kind that would want to come near them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis night was different. I could hear the backdoor slide open, the sound of feet tapping against the floor catching my attention. “Daddy?” my son called.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked over my shoulder. “Yes, Noah?” I replied, noticing the fear in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a man outside,” he said, pointing behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI frowned, Linda sitting up to look at our son. “What do mean, buddy? Does someone need to talk to me?” I said, standing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoah shook his head. “He’s out in the woods,” he said, looking as if he were about to start crying. “He looks naked.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was moving towards the door before he’d finished speaking. My hand reached for my rifle as I stepped through the backdoor, my eyes thankfully landing on Carly. Bailey stood a few feet in front of my daughter, growling at the man who stood in forest. As Noah had recalled, the man was indeed not wearing clothing, but there was something… *odd* about him. It was hard to tell from this far away, but the man’s skin looked gray. It looked as if he’d been dead for over a month, yet decided to come back to life, just to stand in my backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knelt beside my nine-year-old daughter, who had started to cry. “Go inside, honey,” I said, turning to look at our back door. Linda stood in the doorway, confusion in her eyes. I helped Carly up the steps, turning my attention back to the man as the backdoor slid shut. The man had not moved. He remained motionless, staring directly at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get the fuck out of here,” I called, holding the rifle in my hands. “You’re on private property.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man did not react. He continued to stare at me from the edge of the forest. “I’m warning you, buddy. I don’t know what you’re on right now, but I know you understand what I’m saying,” I called out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes burned through me. He didn’t look like he was intending on leaving. “Get out of here,” I called, raising the rifle. “Don’t fucking test me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man hadn’t blinked since I’d seen him. I swore under my breath, shifting nervously on my feet. This pervert was standing in *my* backyard, wearing no clothing and watching my young children play. I was sure no one would miss that sick son of a bitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI aimed at the man and fired. As I pulled the trigger, within the blink of an eye, the man was gone. My eyes scanned the trees. Had he started running? I searched for several minutes but couldn’t find the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to the house, my family shaken up inside. I told them that I’d scared the man off, but Linda could tell I was lying. The kids were relieved, however, and praised me as if I were a hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t sleep last night. I just listened to Linda breathe softly in her sleep as I pictured the man’s naked body. I almost prayed that he would come back, so that I could teach him what would happen if he tried to stare at my kids like that again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, I’d walked out my back porch with Bailey, ready for our morning routine. I was immediately met with a horrific sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trees had moved closer. The edge of the trees now stood a mere two hundred feet from my back door. Out further on my property, a large tree stood tall in the spot where the sheep’s pen had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to run towards the pen, Bailey practically tripping me as we moved quickly across my property.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sight was gruesome. Trees stuck up out of the ground from inside of the small barn we’d built for the sheep. The front half of Rocket laid lifeless on the ground in a pool of blood, a tree in the ground directly behind her. I could not find the other sheep, but I knew their bodies were inside what remained of the barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood there for a while, rubbing my face. What the fuck was happening? How could this even be possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would I tell the kids?\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned, ready to head back to the house. In my daze, I hadn’t noticed the severity of my problem. The trees had moved closer, yes, but now a thick wall of trees surrounded the entirety of my property. Shocked, I ran to the front of my house. Massive trees formed a circle around the house, their trunks touching. I ran up to the wall of bark, slamming my fist against it. They were *very* real.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran back to the house, Linda now standing in the front door, fear in her eyes. “Frank…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get back in the house, Linda,” I said, running for my shed. I searched through the pile of junk, eventually finding what I was looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nI carried the axe back to the front of the house, running for the wall of trees. Bailey barked excitedly behind me as we ran. I lifted the axe behind me, swinging it as hard as I could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe axe slammed against the side of the tree, practically bouncing off of it. I tried several more times. By the time I’d tired myself out, not a single mark had been made in the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pulled out my cell phone, calling the only person I knew I would listen to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chuck,” I practically shouted as he picked up the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frank,” he said, sensing my fear. “What’s wrong?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please get over here,” I said, tapping my foot. “Bring your chainsaw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frank-” he said, cut off by my temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“*Now,* Chuck,” I said, rubbing my forehead. “It’s an emergency.”\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck arrived a short time later. I could hear him through the wall as he approached. “Jesus Christ…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chuck!” I called, met with a brief silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frank? Where are you?” he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You need to get this wall down, man,” I said, banging on the tree. My knuckles began to hurt. “Please.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure...?” he called. “These trees are really fucking tall, man…”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just fucking do it, Chuck,” I shouted, ignoring his words.\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck revved his chainsaw. I looked back to the house, Linda watching from the window. The kids must have still been asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck’s chainsaw started, drawing my attention. I could hear the tool connect with the tree on the other side. A loud clang shot through the tree, followed by Chuck’s brief scream.\\r\\n\\r\\nI froze, anxious. “Chuck? Chuck, what happened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The thing broke my damn saw,” he said, a thud audible as he tossed the broken tool to the ground. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait there, Chuck,” I cried, running to the house. I threw open the front door, my wife’s eyes on me. “Get the kids. We’re leaving.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How? We can't get through those damn trees, Frank,” she cried, as I ran for the back door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll go through the woods,” I said, stepping out onto the back porch. Bailey followed me as I moved out into the backyard. I froze, my eyes landing on the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople were standing in the forest. Like the man, they were all naked, with dark gray skin. And there were *hundreds* of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognized one, then. I was almost certain that it was my neighbor, Hector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hector!” I called, my fear escaping through my voice. As I’d expected, the man who I thought had been Hector didn’t reply. Instead, he stared back at me with dead eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran back into the house, shutting the door once Bailey had made it inside. Linda stopped as she descended from the staircase, holding Carly. Noah stood behind her, confusion in his eyes. “What’s wrong?” Linda asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get the kids up in the bedroom, Linda,” I said, grabbing my gun. “Lock the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy words scared my kids. They began to cry as Linda pushed them back up the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took out my cellphone and called the police. It was the only thing I could think of doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stayed on the line with the operator, who had thankfully listened to my story. She had likely sent the officers more in response to the part about the people in my backyard, and less for the supposed wall of trees, but it didn’t matter to me. So along as they were coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce police arrived, I got back on the phone with Chuck. I could hear the police in the background, astounded by what they were seeing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry, man,” Chuck said. “They’re telling me that they’ll get you out of there soon. They want to know why you planted trees here in the first place.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned, rubbing my face. “I didn’t, Chuck. Tell them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck spoke to the police for a while before returning. “They don’t believe you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s fine, Chuck,” I said. “Just get us the fuck out of here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re calling a helicopter in,” he said. “It’ll be here soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI sighed, relieved. I looked out my window. The wall had to be only a hundred feet tall, at the most. A helicopter could easily pass that.\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck sounded surprised when the police started to speak to him, nearly half an hour later. “What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s wrong, Chuck?” I asked, watching the people in my backyard through the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re trying to tell me they can’t fly over to you guys,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“*What?*” I replied. I failed to see how that could be possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re saying that no matter how high they go, the wall keeps getting taller. I don’t know what to tell you, Frank. They’re trying, okay?” he said, sounding frazzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned. “Just… just hurry,” I said, staring out into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a long conversation with Linda as we waited. We talked about what we would do if the trees got too close - we were going to run into the woods and try to go around. Her eyes remained locked on the forest for the second half of the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo progress was made by the police that day. The people in the forest remained there, unmoving, when I eventually fell asleep on the couch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, I woke up to hear the sound of my backdoor sliding open. I sat up quickly, reaching for my gun. Linda stood in the doorway, stepping out into the backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Linda!” I called, running to the door in a daze. “Linda, what are you doing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nLinda cried out as she ran out into the backyard, her feet bare. “They want *me,* Frank! Come with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI froze in the doorway. The trees were much closer now, less than a hundred feet from my house. Linda was nearly there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“*Linda!*” I called out to my wife, not ready for this change in her attitude. I ran from the house, the gun in my hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinda vanished as she passed the border into the woods. I nearly tripped as I ran, stopping myself as the people in the woods began to emerge, seemingly appearing from nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart was pounding in my chest. “*LINDA!*” I cried. She was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had all happened so quickly. Within the span of a single minute, I'd both woken up and lost my wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Daddy?!” I heard a call from behind me. Carly and Noah stood in the doorway, shock on their faces. \\r\\n\\r\\nI ran to my children, forcing them inside and shutting the door. “What did you two just see?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are all those people?” Noah asked, looking through the backdoor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s Mommy?” Carly asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get upstairs, and lock yourself in my room,” I said. “Do *NOT* come back out unless I’m talking to you. Do you understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy children hesitated before finally nodding. I waited for them to go upstairs before exiting my house through the front door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wall in front of our house was closer now. I hadn’t realized just how dark it was out here. The trees blocked the morning sun. \\r\\n\\r\\nI called Chuck on my phone. As I’d expected, my old friend remained outside of the wall with the police.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chuck, Linda is gone,” I said, finally beginning to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frank, what the hell are you talking about?” he said, shocked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She ran out into the trees, man… I think they took her,” I said, rubbing my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some of the cops went in the woods a few hours ago to try to get to you guys,” he said, sounding desperate. “Maybe they found her out there? Have some hope, damn it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t hold on to that hope. I knew my wife was gone. I just had a feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s been over twenty-four hours since Linda ran into the woods. The trees are practically on my back porch, now. God, it is so dark out there. The kids are upstairs in my room, hopefully not looking out the window I’d covered up. \\r\\n\\r\\nLinda is standing out in the backyard beside a large tree, her naked skin a dark gray. I want to open the door and let her in, but I know the Linda I love is gone. That isn't really her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI imagine the house will be covered come tomorrow morning. There’s not much left for me to do. I just hope its quick when we inevitably go. For Noah and Carly, more than for myself. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve been fighting the insane urge to run outside and join Linda. It’s like they’re calling to me. They must want to keep moving.\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to write to you all as a warning. If you notice anything like this on your own property, get those you care about out of there immediately. I was too late. Now, my babies have to die because of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBailey is sitting by the backdoor. She has no idea what’s going to happen within the next twenty-four hours. I’m in envy, to be frank. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to stop wasting my time here with you. I don’t have much of it left. I’m going to go sit with my kids and play with them until the time comes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll try to respond to any comments on my phone while I can, if there even are any.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Thanks for reading.](http://www.twitter.com/milesbruckner)\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a problem. One I know I won’t be able to fix.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m all out of options. I just need somewhere to vent a little bit, before it’s all over.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I live on a small chunk of property in the middle of Nebraska, with my wife Linda and our two kids, Noah and Carly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a peaceful life. Linda has a garden she takes care of with the kids. A few months back, I bought a few sheep. Linda likes to make clothing out of the wool and sell them to anyone who’s willing to buy. The kids like them as pets, of course. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our property sits right beside a large forest. It really was massive. I’d never felt the need to explore it, as it wasn’t our property in the first place. The kids, on the other hand, constantly needed to be reminded. I’d often let them play around the edge of the woods, but the second any of them got too far in, I would yell and call them back. I was never serious, of course. It became somewhat of a game for us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning was no different than any other. I woke up early every day to check on the sheep and take our dog Bailey outside. She’s a great dog. She stays right beside me and doesn’t bark at the sheep. That’s all I could ask for, really.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was the one who spent most of my free time out on the property. I knew it like the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I approached the sheep pen, the ewes looking up at me as I approached. They began to bleat as I entered the shed that sat beside their home, lifting the heavy bag of food.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dumped the food into the trough, watching as the sheep began to flock towards their meal. There were four sheep, one for each of us. I named mine Dolly, of course. My wife named hers Beth. She says she just liked the name. Noah named his Rocket, which I had told him was an odd name for a girl sheep. He didn’t seem to care. Naturally, Carly named hers Fluffy. I don’t think I need to explain that one to you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I set down the bag of food, wiping the sweat from my forehead. As I knelt to pick the bag back up, something odd in the distance caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t completely sure, but it was almost as if there were more trees in the forest than there had been the previous day. I began to walk towards the woods, Bailey close behind me. As I approached, the change became obvious. Every tree, every rock, every bump on the ground was a landmark to me. Hundreds of trees had somehow grown on my property overnight. The forest’s new edge had moved forward nearly ten feet, at least.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bailey sniffed at one of the trees as I approached the forest, placing my hand against the bark. It was solid, a strong tree. It felt as if it had been here for decades. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back to Bailey who looked impatient to get back to the house. I didn’t blame her. Something felt off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to the house, kissing my wife on the cheek as I found her in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, have you noticed anything different?” I asked, leaning on the countertop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked over her shoulder, the coffee machine humming. “Did you get taller?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed. “No, Linda. I mean &lt;em&gt;outside.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked out the window, frowning. “I don’t see anything out of place, no. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged, pouring myself a glass of water from the faucet. “Oh, it’s nothing. I just thought the trees looked closer than they usually do, that’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My wife looked back outside, chuckling. “They look the same to me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded, downing my drink. “Yeah, I suppose you’re right,” I said, setting my glass down in the sink.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Trees don’t just pop up out of nowhere, Frank,” she said, smiling as I headed back to our bedroom. I couldn’t waste anymore time, or I’d be late for work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My kids hopped around at my feet as I walked to my truck, my eyes glued to the forest. I couldn’t help but feel as if they had moved even closer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That entire day, I couldn’t stop thinking about the woods behind my house. No matter what I did, I just &lt;em&gt;couldn’t stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My company had been working on building a home for the past few weeks now. I stood by my truck, sipping from my water bottle as I stared at my phone. It was nearly six o’clock now.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, if you’re just going to stare at your phone, you may as well just leave,” my friend Chuck said, smirking at me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure?” I said, feeling stupid for getting caught slacking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re alright, Frank,” he said, climbing down from a ladder. “We’ll clean up here.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, Chuck,” I said, stepping around to the driver&amp;#39;s seat. “Linda’s making her chicken tonight. I can’t miss it,” I said, lying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, say hello to Linda for me, will you?” he said. “Haven’t seen your family in a while.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Sure man, you got it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I gripped the steering wheel hard as I drove home, anxious for whatever reason. I felt like I was losing my mind. How could the trees be &lt;em&gt;moving?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I parked my car in the driveway, heading straight for the back of the house. I entered my shed, pulling out a stake from the top shelf.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sun was setting by the time I reached the forest. I looked out into the trees, sighing. I hammered the stake into the ground right between the two closest trees to my property. I’d see just how crazy I was in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner was nice, but it was no chicken, that’s for sure. The next morning, I took Bailey outside, heading straight for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I walked directly to where I’d set the stake, my eyes searching the ground. It was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The thing was, though, it &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; gone. I found it shortly after, about fifteen feet into the forest. I was stunned. Was someone playing a trick on me? Either someone had moved my stake, or another several hundred trees had appeared on my property.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I removed my stake from the ground, I could hear Bailey beginning to growl behind me. I looked to my dog, who was staring out into the woods, her teeth bared. I followed her line of sight, finding nothing but trees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the woods, calling for Bailey to follow me. I had to be losing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain the situation to Linda, but she wouldn’t believe me, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At work that day, we were working extra hard. We always tended to do that on the last day of the work week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know, Chuck,” I said, rubbing my forehead. “I think I may be stressing too much.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck grunted, setting a piece of wood down beside the house. “And why is that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged, stepping aside to start my break. “Oh, you know. Just stupid things.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Like &lt;em&gt;what,&lt;/em&gt; Frank?” Chuck said, following me. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I scratched the back of my neck, sighing. “Well, mostly, I keep thinking that the trees behind my house are getting closer. Shit like that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Frank scoffed. “Really?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Yeah, weird, right?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Frank shook his head. “No, I mean, I thought the same thing. About my house, though, not yours.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned. “Wait, what?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck smiled. “Yeah, I was on the edge of my property, and I thought I saw an extra tree or two,” he said, lighting a cigarette. “It’s weird we did the same thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I grunted. “Yeah, well, I’ve seen a few more than that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, how many?” Chuck said, placing the cigarette in between his lips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The trees have moved up almost twenty-five feet, now,” I said, suddenly embarrassed. “Or, I least I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they have.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck squinted, nodding slowly as he inhaled. We sat in silence as he held in the smoke, finally exhaling. “Yeah, you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be stressed, Frank.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You two going to get back to work any time soon?” our friend Jim called from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We just got on break, shithead,” Chuck replied, rolling his eyes at me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We made great progress that day. We’d probably be finished with the house by the end of the next week.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the way home, I stopped at the local Chinese food place in town to pick up dinner. It wasn’t a Friday night without our Chinese takeout.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The owners had my order ready for when I entered the restaurant. I paid and headed home, choosing to push aside any thoughts of the forest. The weekend was for relaxation, after all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner was delicious, as always. Every Friday night, Linda and I would watch our favorite show on the television, while Noah and Carly would spend time playing together. Tonight, they were outside in the backyard with Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We lived in the middle of nowhere. I never feared letting my children play outside at night. I’d done it as a child, myself. The only thing they needed to fear was the rare wild animal, and that only included the kind that would want to come near them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This night was different. I could hear the backdoor slide open, the sound of feet tapping against the floor catching my attention. “Daddy?” my son called.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over my shoulder. “Yes, Noah?” I replied, noticing the fear in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s a man outside,” he said, pointing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned, Linda sitting up to look at our son. “What do mean, buddy? Does someone need to talk to me?” I said, standing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Noah shook his head. “He’s out in the woods,” he said, looking as if he were about to start crying. “He looks naked.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was moving towards the door before he’d finished speaking. My hand reached for my rifle as I stepped through the backdoor, my eyes thankfully landing on Carly. Bailey stood a few feet in front of my daughter, growling at the man who stood in forest. As Noah had recalled, the man was indeed not wearing clothing, but there was something… &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; about him. It was hard to tell from this far away, but the man’s skin looked gray. It looked as if he’d been dead for over a month, yet decided to come back to life, just to stand in my backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt beside my nine-year-old daughter, who had started to cry. “Go inside, honey,” I said, turning to look at our back door. Linda stood in the doorway, confusion in her eyes. I helped Carly up the steps, turning my attention back to the man as the backdoor slid shut. The man had not moved. He remained motionless, staring directly at me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Get the fuck out of here,” I called, holding the rifle in my hands. “You’re on private property.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man did not react. He continued to stare at me from the edge of the forest. “I’m warning you, buddy. I don’t know what you’re on right now, but I know you understand what I’m saying,” I called out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes burned through me. He didn’t look like he was intending on leaving. “Get out of here,” I called, raising the rifle. “Don’t fucking test me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man hadn’t blinked since I’d seen him. I swore under my breath, shifting nervously on my feet. This pervert was standing in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; backyard, wearing no clothing and watching my young children play. I was sure no one would miss that sick son of a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I aimed at the man and fired. As I pulled the trigger, within the blink of an eye, the man was gone. My eyes scanned the trees. Had he started running? I searched for several minutes but couldn’t find the man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to the house, my family shaken up inside. I told them that I’d scared the man off, but Linda could tell I was lying. The kids were relieved, however, and praised me as if I were a hero.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t sleep last night. I just listened to Linda breathe softly in her sleep as I pictured the man’s naked body. I almost prayed that he would come back, so that I could teach him what would happen if he tried to stare at my kids like that again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I’d walked out my back porch with Bailey, ready for our morning routine. I was immediately met with a horrific sight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The trees had moved closer. The edge of the trees now stood a mere two hundred feet from my back door. Out further on my property, a large tree stood tall in the spot where the sheep’s pen had been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began to run towards the pen, Bailey practically tripping me as we moved quickly across my property.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sight was gruesome. Trees stuck up out of the ground from inside of the small barn we’d built for the sheep. The front half of Rocket laid lifeless on the ground in a pool of blood, a tree in the ground directly behind her. I could not find the other sheep, but I knew their bodies were inside what remained of the barn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there for a while, rubbing my face. What the fuck was happening? How could this even be possible?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How would I tell the kids?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned, ready to head back to the house. In my daze, I hadn’t noticed the severity of my problem. The trees had moved closer, yes, but now a thick wall of trees surrounded the entirety of my property. Shocked, I ran to the front of my house. Massive trees formed a circle around the house, their trunks touching. I ran up to the wall of bark, slamming my fist against it. They were &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; real.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran back to the house, Linda now standing in the front door, fear in her eyes. “Frank…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Get back in the house, Linda,” I said, running for my shed. I searched through the pile of junk, eventually finding what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I carried the axe back to the front of the house, running for the wall of trees. Bailey barked excitedly behind me as we ran. I lifted the axe behind me, swinging it as hard as I could.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The axe slammed against the side of the tree, practically bouncing off of it. I tried several more times. By the time I’d tired myself out, not a single mark had been made in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my cell phone, calling the only person I knew I would listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chuck,” I practically shouted as he picked up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Frank,” he said, sensing my fear. “What’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Please get over here,” I said, tapping my foot. “Bring your chainsaw.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Frank-” he said, cut off by my temper.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Now,&lt;/em&gt; Chuck,” I said, rubbing my forehead. “It’s an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck arrived a short time later. I could hear him through the wall as he approached. “Jesus Christ…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chuck!” I called, met with a brief silence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Frank? Where are you?” he shouted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You need to get this wall down, man,” I said, banging on the tree. My knuckles began to hurt. “Please.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure...?” he called. “These trees are really fucking tall, man…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just fucking do it, Chuck,” I shouted, ignoring his words.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck revved his chainsaw. I looked back to the house, Linda watching from the window. The kids must have still been asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck’s chainsaw started, drawing my attention. I could hear the tool connect with the tree on the other side. A loud clang shot through the tree, followed by Chuck’s brief scream.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, anxious. “Chuck? Chuck, what happened?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The thing broke my damn saw,” he said, a thud audible as he tossed the broken tool to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait there, Chuck,” I cried, running to the house. I threw open the front door, my wife’s eyes on me. “Get the kids. We’re leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How? We can&amp;#39;t get through those damn trees, Frank,” she cried, as I ran for the back door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ll go through the woods,” I said, stepping out onto the back porch. Bailey followed me as I moved out into the backyard. I froze, my eyes landing on the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;People were standing in the forest. Like the man, they were all naked, with dark gray skin. And there were &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I recognized one, then. I was almost certain that it was my neighbor, Hector.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hector!” I called, my fear escaping through my voice. As I’d expected, the man who I thought had been Hector didn’t reply. Instead, he stared back at me with dead eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran back into the house, shutting the door once Bailey had made it inside. Linda stopped as she descended from the staircase, holding Carly. Noah stood behind her, confusion in his eyes. “What’s wrong?” Linda asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Get the kids up in the bedroom, Linda,” I said, grabbing my gun. “Lock the door.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My words scared my kids. They began to cry as Linda pushed them back up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took out my cellphone and called the police. It was the only thing I could think of doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed on the line with the operator, who had thankfully listened to my story. She had likely sent the officers more in response to the part about the people in my backyard, and less for the supposed wall of trees, but it didn’t matter to me. So along as they were coming.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once police arrived, I got back on the phone with Chuck. I could hear the police in the background, astounded by what they were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry, man,” Chuck said. “They’re telling me that they’ll get you out of there soon. They want to know why you planted trees here in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I groaned, rubbing my face. “I didn’t, Chuck. Tell them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck spoke to the police for a while before returning. “They don’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s fine, Chuck,” I said. “Just get us the fuck out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re calling a helicopter in,” he said. “It’ll be here soon.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed, relieved. I looked out my window. The wall had to be only a hundred feet tall, at the most. A helicopter could easily pass that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chuck sounded surprised when the police started to speak to him, nearly half an hour later. “What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong, Chuck?” I asked, watching the people in my backyard through the window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re trying to tell me they can’t fly over to you guys,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;” I replied. I failed to see how that could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re saying that no matter how high they go, the wall keeps getting taller. I don’t know what to tell you, Frank. They’re trying, okay?” he said, sounding frazzled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I groaned. “Just… just hurry,” I said, staring out into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had a long conversation with Linda as we waited. We talked about what we would do if the trees got too close - we were going to run into the woods and try to go around. Her eyes remained locked on the forest for the second half of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No progress was made by the police that day. The people in the forest remained there, unmoving, when I eventually fell asleep on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I woke up to hear the sound of my backdoor sliding open. I sat up quickly, reaching for my gun. Linda stood in the doorway, stepping out into the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Linda!” I called, running to the door in a daze. “Linda, what are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Linda cried out as she ran out into the backyard, her feet bare. “They want &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; Frank! Come with me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze in the doorway. The trees were much closer now, less than a hundred feet from my house. Linda was nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Linda!&lt;/em&gt;” I called out to my wife, not ready for this change in her attitude. I ran from the house, the gun in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Linda vanished as she passed the border into the woods. I nearly tripped as I ran, stopping myself as the people in the woods began to emerge, seemingly appearing from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart was pounding in my chest. “&lt;em&gt;LINDA!&lt;/em&gt;” I cried. She was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It had all happened so quickly. Within the span of a single minute, I&amp;#39;d both woken up and lost my wife.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Daddy?!” I heard a call from behind me. Carly and Noah stood in the doorway, shock on their faces. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran to my children, forcing them inside and shutting the door. “What did you two just see?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Who are all those people?” Noah asked, looking through the backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where’s Mommy?” Carly asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Get upstairs, and lock yourself in my room,” I said. “Do &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; come back out unless I’m talking to you. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My children hesitated before finally nodding. I waited for them to go upstairs before exiting my house through the front door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wall in front of our house was closer now. I hadn’t realized just how dark it was out here. The trees blocked the morning sun. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I called Chuck on my phone. As I’d expected, my old friend remained outside of the wall with the police.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chuck, Linda is gone,” I said, finally beginning to cry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Frank, what the hell are you talking about?” he said, shocked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She ran out into the trees, man… I think they took her,” I said, rubbing my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Some of the cops went in the woods a few hours ago to try to get to you guys,” he said, sounding desperate. “Maybe they found her out there? Have some hope, damn it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t hold on to that hope. I knew my wife was gone. I just had a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been over twenty-four hours since Linda ran into the woods. The trees are practically on my back porch, now. God, it is so dark out there. The kids are upstairs in my room, hopefully not looking out the window I’d covered up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Linda is standing out in the backyard beside a large tree, her naked skin a dark gray. I want to open the door and let her in, but I know the Linda I love is gone. That isn&amp;#39;t really her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine the house will be covered come tomorrow morning. There’s not much left for me to do. I just hope its quick when we inevitably go. For Noah and Carly, more than for myself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fighting the insane urge to run outside and join Linda. It’s like they’re calling to me. They must want to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to write to you all as a warning. If you notice anything like this on your own property, get those you care about out of there immediately. I was too late. Now, my babies have to die because of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bailey is sitting by the backdoor. She has no idea what’s going to happen within the next twenty-four hours. I’m in envy, to be frank. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m going to stop wasting my time here with you. I don’t have much of it left. I’m going to go sit with my kids and play with them until the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to respond to any comments on my phone while I can, if there even are any.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/milesbruckner\"&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Being the new guy sucks. It also sucks when you move to a new town and literally everyone knows you\\'re the new guy.\\n\\nI\\'m a tree trimmer, but I usually tell the ladies I\\'m a lumberjack. I recently moved to Oakvale, and got a better paying job at a more well known tree removal service in the next town over.\\n\\nOakvale seemed great at first. It was overflowing with greenery. Thick, lush grass grew everywhere, but not in a sloppy, overgrown sort of way. Flowers occupied every space possible, and strong, hearty trees were abundant. \\n\\nI got a great price on a small, but quaint house with a couple acres of land. What really sold me on the house though, was the ancient oak tree that towered in the backyard, at the edge of the property.\\n\\nThere were other trees on the property, of course. Every property seemed to value trees over wide, open space. But it was that oak tree that really caught my attention. \\n\\nIt was awe-inspiring. It seemed to emit this powerful aura, and upon seeing it for the first time, I was immediately transfixed. I think the realtor was saying something about the previous owner, but I didn\\'t hear her. I was just completely enraptured by this tree. \\n\\nI was moving from a house I had previously rented with some old college buddies, Rob and Mike. It was great, we all sat around drinking beer, watching tv and playing video games. We hung out everyday.\\n\\nBut I decided enough was enough, and it was time to grow up. Chris the Lumberjack was way more successful with women than my roommates were, but I knew at some point down the road I was going to want to settle down and be a real adult.\\n\\nSo I got myself a better paying job, bought a small, two bedroom house, and packed my stuff up. My buddies were sad to see me go, but I couldn\\'t party with them forever. \\n\\nSome of the locals though, they\\'re a little weird. On my move-in day, my neighbors came to introduce themselves. When I mentioned what I did and where I\\'d be working, their initially warm and friendly demeanor turned cold.\\n\\nThey excused themselves as quickly as they could and hurried home. After that, everyone else who lived on my street started giving me long, weird looks. Whenever I walked down the street, everyone shut and locked their doors.\\n\\nThen there was this hot chick I bumped into at the grocery store. Like literally. I crashed my cart into hers. Classic grocery store pickup.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned I had just moved here, she was really intrigued. But as soon as I told her I was a lumberjack, a line that usually worked very well, she glared at me and stomped away.\\n\\nPeople around here seem to take care of the town very well. Everyone plants flowers wherever they can, they let the grass grow out a little longer than what would be considered normal, and they\\'re always planting new trees.\\n\\nOn weekends, everyone can be seen kneeling in the grass, weeding their flowerbeds or spreading fertilizer. There are always sales everywhere for seeds and flowers. You can buy flowers at like any store in town. \\n\\nSo I was surprised when one Friday night, I was walking home from the bar after work, and this younger boy was walking in front of me. He wore a blue baseball cap on his head, backwards. He had been drinking an energy drink from a can, and when he was finished, he just nonchalantly tossed the can over his shoulder. \\n\\n\"Hey! Kid!\" I had called after him, as I bent to pick up his can. \"You shouldn\\'t litter!\"\\n\\nBut when I stood up, he was gone. Maybe I\\'d had one too many beers, or maybe he ran off and hid somewhere, I don\\'t know. I was left standing in the street, holding his can.\\n\\nI deposited it in a recycling can that had been left at the street for pickup the next day. A couple days later, that kid was declared missing and it was all over the news. They described him as having last been wearing a blue baseball cap, so I knew it was him.\\n\\nThat night when I went to bed, I couldn\\'t seem to settle down. I laid on my back and stared at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to overtake me.\\n\\nInstead, I heard this weird creaking noise coming from outside. Like the sound thick branches make in heavy wind. And every couple of minutes, the ground seemed to shake a little.\\n\\nSo I went outside to investigate. The wind was blowing pretty hard, causing even the thickest of branches on the great oak to sway. \\n\\nOddly enough, the tree seemed to be a little closer than I remembered. Which was weird because I remembered it being closer to the edge of the property. And we all know trees don\\'t just get up and move.\\n\\nI went out onto the grass, hesitating a second as someone\\'s flag flew by. There was no doubt the town would be covered in debris from the stormy winds in the morning.\\n\\nThere seemed to be something weird about the tree trunk. I inched closer, as a bad feeling washed over me.\\n\\nThere definitely was something weird about that tree. The trunk\\'s texture was off.\\n\\nAs I got closer, I could see why. Sticking out of the trunk was a blue hat, exactly like the one I had seen earlier that day. I was wondering how the wind hadn\\'t blown it away, when a strong gust picked it up and carried it off.\\n\\nWith the hat gone, it now exposed the top of a small head, covered in short brown hair. The head was angled so I couldn\\'t see the face. A hand and the tips of shoes also poked out from the bark.\\n\\nI backed away from the tree slowly, trying to process what I was looking at. It wasn\\'t possible. I was probably just having a bad dream, right? Probably just had too many beers earlier.\\n\\nI retreated back to my house. Before going back upstairs to bed, I turned and peered out the window that overlooked the backyard. Very faintly, I could still make out the shape of a small figure embedded in the tree trunk.\\n\\nThe wind shook the branches, almost as if the tree was waving at me. I could feel an ominous aura emanating from the tree, even from my current distance. I went up to bed, hoping to wake from this bizarre, freakish dream.\\n\\nA bright light burned my eyelids, waking me up. The sun was shining outside, as if the storm last night hadn\\'t even happened. Maybe it had been just a weird dream.\\n\\nI headed downstairs and outside. Despite the warm, friendly sun, my lawn was littered with trash and an assortment of other things. Decorations from my neighbors\\' houses were all over the place. \\n\\nIt looked the same everywhere. Garbage was strewn up and down the streets, all over my neighbors\\' lawns, caught on fences and the branches of the trees everywhere.\\n\\nI approached the great oak, cautiously. A bad feeling was rising from the pit of my stomach. The surrounding trees all seemed to be watching me, expectantly.\\n\\nI breathed a sigh of relief. There was no boy sticking out of the trunk of my tree. Upon closer inspection, I frowned. \\n\\nThe deep brown bark seemed to be stained a rusty red. I ran a hand over the rough bark, but nothing felt any different. Maybe the tree was getting sick. Or maybe in the storm, something spilled on it. I\\'d have to look at it later, I had to get to work.\\n\\nThe rest of the morning passed quickly. It seemed the storm had affected the surrounding towns as well, so we had plenty of work to do. We worked in teams, each group had a laundry list of locations to visit. \\n\\nA lot of downed trees and branches shut down some roads and cut off traffic. We needed to clear them as efficiently as possible. We had a wood chipper hitched to the back of our service truck.\\n\\nDuring a water break, some of the guys asked about Oakvale.\\n\\n\"How ya like living there? It\\'s a real pretty place to live, but we never seem to get service calls there.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Its real nice. I got a small house, but the land it\\'s on has some real potential.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe we should have a cookout!\" Chimed another coworker.\\n\\n\"Yeah, maybe. I don\\'t know. The locals seem a little weird.\"\\n\\n\"Weird? Then you should fit right in!\" They all laughed about that.\\n\\n\"Haha, yeah. I don\\'t know. They all seem to dislike me, but I don\\'t even know any of them. I try to introduce myself and they just get weird,\" I tried to explain.\\n\\n\"Huh, striking out with the ladies?\" Someone razzed, causing another round of chuckles.\\n\\n\"Yeah, I guess. And then last night with this weird storm, it almost seemed like there was a body in the tree in my yard.\" Everyone stopped laughing when I mentioned that. \\n\\n\"A body? Like hanging or like [Charlie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ceik2i/the_taking_tree/) style?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s Charlie style?\" I frowned.\\n\\n\"I dunno. Some whackjob in some town lost his mind. Think his name was Charlie. Keeps rambling on and on about this tree that absorbed or ate his cousin or something. Guy\\'s definitely off his rocker, takes one look at a tree and starts screaming his head off. They have to keep him in a windowless room.\"\\n\\n\"Y\\'all are screwing with me right?\" I asked nervously. Had something like this really happened before?\\n\\nThe longest minute of silence ever passed by. Then all the guys started laughing at me, except the one who had mentioned Charlie. I could see him looking at me nervously long after our break was over and we pulled back into the truck to go to our next stop.\\n\\nWhen I returned home, all the trash in the yards and streets had been cleaned up. Tightly knotted trash bags (biodegradable, of course. The only kind the stores around here carried) were nearly lined up along the street, waiting to be picked up. \\n\\nAs I parked my truck in the driveway and stepped out, my neighbors marched right up to me, their arms crossed.\\n\\n\"You know, we like to keep our town clean.\"\\n\\n\"Yeh, I noticed that,\" I said with a smirk, trying to lighten the mood. It didn\\'t work. \\n\\n\"You need to do your share if you\\'re going to live here. We all had to clean up your yard today while you were off murdering trees!\" \\n\\n“Ma’am, first, thank you for cleaning up my yard. I was planning on doing it when I got home, but I appreciate the help. Second, I don’t murder trees.”\\n\\n“I don’t want to hear another blasphemous lie out of your mouth!” She said sharply. She turned on her heel and marched away. Her husband followed.\\n\\nI sighed and shook my head. Maybe the crazies were trying to run me out of town. Maybe there was something in the water.\\n\\nI headed into the backyard to take a look at the oak tree. It didn’t appear to have moved again, but I couldn\\'t be sure. And the reddish stain on the trunk had disappeared too. Maybe I had just been imagining things.\\n\\nJust then, my phone started to ring. I headed inside to answer it, so my neighbors couldn\\'t eavesdrop. It ended up being one of my old roommates, asking how everything was going in the new house.\\n\\nThe following day was Saturday, but I invited them all over for Sunday. The next day I could clean up and make the place as presentable as possible. I was pretty much unpacked, but I still had empty boxes everywhere.\\n\\nSaturday morning rolled around and I decided to enjoy my coffee in the backyard. Looking over the yard, I felt pretty pleased with myself. In just a couple weeks, I had taken a big step towards being a real adult. I had gotten a better paying job, I\\'d moved out of the bachelor house, and even bought my first starter home.\\n\\nI guess the first thing I could do was to make some improvements around the house. The easiest thing I could do would be the spruce up the exterior. \\n\\nHeading outside, I surveyed my yard. The grass could use some cutting. By most standards, there were really too many trees in the yard, but I didn’t have all the equipment to cut them down. The branches were overgrown and becoming entangled. If another storm came through and broke a branch, it could cause a domino effect, or damage someone’s house. \\n\\nWhen I downed my cup of coffee, I got started mowing the lawn. Then, I did what I knew best. I trimmed the trees. I didn\\'t really want to cut any of them down, I was pretty sure my neighbors would kill me. But I could thin out some of the branches, right?\\n\\nBy the time I finished, it was already late afternoon, and my lawn was covered with sticks and pieces of wood. I didn\\'t have a fireplace, but maybe sometime soon, I could build a firepit or something. Everyone loved a good bonfire, right?\\n\\nThe rest of the day passed uneventfully, though I would be lying if I said I wasn\\'t waiting for a mob to form outside my house with pitchforks. Luckily, none of that happened. I didn\\'t even get any weird looks when I went to the grocery store. \\n\\nWhen I got home, I checked the mailbox. There was the usual collection of bills and preapproved credit card offers promising no annual fees. There was also a flyer advertising a community event on Sunday. \\n\\nIt mentioned the community was going to pull together and clean up the green spaces and maintain the flowerbeds. They would also be planting a community garden in the town center. \\n\\nThere would also be a presentation about what we could do to further reduce our carbon footprint and small things we could incorporate into our daily lives to help the environment. In all honesty it sounded boring and awful. Good thing I already had plans for my Sunday. \\n\\nHidden behind the flyer was a letter. \\n\\n“We are watching.”',\n",

The wind was blowing pretty hard, causing even the thickest of branches on the great oak to sway. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the tree seemed to be a little closer than I remembered. Which was weird because I remembered it being closer to the edge of the property. And we all know trees don&amp;#39;t just get up and move.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went out onto the grass, hesitating a second as someone&amp;#39;s flag flew by. There was no doubt the town would be covered in debris from the stormy winds in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be something weird about the tree trunk. I inched closer, as a bad feeling washed over me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There definitely was something weird about that tree. The trunk&amp;#39;s texture was off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I got closer, I could see why. Sticking out of the trunk was a blue hat, exactly like the one I had seen earlier that day. I was wondering how the wind hadn&amp;#39;t blown it away, when a strong gust picked it up and carried it off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With the hat gone, it now exposed the top of a small head, covered in short brown hair. The head was angled so I couldn&amp;#39;t see the face. A hand and the tips of shoes also poked out from the bark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I backed away from the tree slowly, trying to process what I was looking at. It wasn&amp;#39;t possible. I was probably just having a bad dream, right? Probably just had too many beers earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I retreated back to my house. Before going back upstairs to bed, I turned and peered out the window that overlooked the backyard. Very faintly, I could still make out the shape of a small figure embedded in the tree trunk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wind shook the branches, almost as if the tree was waving at me. I could feel an ominous aura emanating from the tree, even from my current distance. I went up to bed, hoping to wake from this bizarre, freakish dream.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A bright light burned my eyelids, waking me up. The sun was shining outside, as if the storm last night hadn&amp;#39;t even happened. Maybe it had been just a weird dream.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed downstairs and outside. Despite the warm, friendly sun, my lawn was littered with trash and an assortment of other things. Decorations from my neighbors&amp;#39; houses were all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It looked the same everywhere. Garbage was strewn up and down the streets, all over my neighbors&amp;#39; lawns, caught on fences and the branches of the trees everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I approached the great oak, cautiously. A bad feeling was rising from the pit of my stomach. The surrounding trees all seemed to be watching me, expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief. There was no boy sticking out of the trunk of my tree. Upon closer inspection, I frowned. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The deep brown bark seemed to be stained a rusty red. I ran a hand over the rough bark, but nothing felt any different. Maybe the tree was getting sick. Or maybe in the storm, something spilled on it. I&amp;#39;d have to look at it later, I had to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the morning passed quickly. It seemed the storm had affected the surrounding towns as well, so we had plenty of work to do. We worked in teams, each group had a laundry list of locations to visit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of downed trees and branches shut down some roads and cut off traffic. We needed to clear them as efficiently as possible. We had a wood chipper hitched to the back of our service truck.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During a water break, some of the guys asked about Oakvale.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How ya like living there? It&amp;#39;s a real pretty place to live, but we never seem to get service calls there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;Its real nice. I got a small house, but the land it&amp;#39;s on has some real potential.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe we should have a cookout!&amp;quot; Chimed another coworker.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, maybe. I don&amp;#39;t know. The locals seem a little weird.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Weird? Then you should fit right in!&amp;quot; They all laughed about that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Haha, yeah. I don&amp;#39;t know. They all seem to dislike me, but I don&amp;#39;t even know any of them. I try to introduce myself and they just get weird,&amp;quot; I tried to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh, striking out with the ladies?&amp;quot; Someone razzed, causing another round of chuckles.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, I guess. And then last night with this weird storm, it almost seemed like there was a body in the tree in my yard.&amp;quot; Everyone stopped laughing when I mentioned that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A body? Like hanging or like &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ceik2i/the_taking_tree/\"&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt; style?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s Charlie style?&amp;quot; I frowned.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I dunno. Some whackjob in some town lost his mind. Think his name was Charlie. Keeps rambling on and on about this tree that absorbed or ate his cousin or something. Guy&amp;#39;s definitely off his rocker, takes one look at a tree and starts screaming his head off. They have to keep him in a windowless room.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Y&amp;#39;all are screwing with me right?&amp;quot; I asked nervously. Had something like this really happened before?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The longest minute of silence ever passed by. Then all the guys started laughing at me, except the one who had mentioned Charlie. I could see him looking at me nervously long after our break was over and we pulled back into the truck to go to our next stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I returned home, all the trash in the yards and streets had been cleaned up. Tightly knotted trash bags (biodegradable, of course. The only kind the stores around here carried) were nearly lined up along the street, waiting to be picked up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I parked my truck in the driveway and stepped out, my neighbors marched right up to me, their arms crossed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know, we like to keep our town clean.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeh, I noticed that,&amp;quot; I said with a smirk, trying to lighten the mood. It didn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You need to do your share if you&amp;#39;re going to live here. We all had to clean up your yard today while you were off murdering trees!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am, first, thank you for cleaning up my yard. I was planning on doing it when I got home, but I appreciate the help. Second, I don’t murder trees.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to hear another blasphemous lie out of your mouth!” She said sharply. She turned on her heel and marched away. Her husband followed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed and shook my head. Maybe the crazies were trying to run me out of town. Maybe there was something in the water.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I headed into the backyard to take a look at the oak tree. It didn’t appear to have moved again, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure. And the reddish stain on the trunk had disappeared too. Maybe I had just been imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, my phone started to ring. I headed inside to answer it, so my neighbors couldn&amp;#39;t eavesdrop. It ended up being one of my old roommates, asking how everything was going in the new house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The following day was Saturday, but I invited them all over for Sunday. The next day I could clean up and make the place as presentable as possible. I was pretty much unpacked, but I still had empty boxes everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning rolled around and I decided to enjoy my coffee in the backyard. Looking over the yard, I felt pretty pleased with myself. In just a couple weeks, I had taken a big step towards being a real adult. I had gotten a better paying job, I&amp;#39;d moved out of the bachelor house, and even bought my first starter home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the first thing I could do was to make some improvements around the house. The easiest thing I could do would be the spruce up the exterior. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Heading outside, I surveyed my yard. The grass could use some cutting. By most standards, there were really too many trees in the yard, but I didn’t have all the equipment to cut them down. The branches were overgrown and becoming entangled. If another storm came through and broke a branch, it could cause a domino effect, or damage someone’s house. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I downed my cup of coffee, I got started mowing the lawn. Then, I did what I knew best. I trimmed the trees. I didn&amp;#39;t really want to cut any of them down, I was pretty sure my neighbors would kill me. But I could thin out some of the branches, right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I finished, it was already late afternoon, and my lawn was covered with sticks and pieces of wood. I didn&amp;#39;t have a fireplace, but maybe sometime soon, I could build a firepit or something. Everyone loved a good bonfire, right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day passed uneventfully, though I would be lying if I said I wasn&amp;#39;t waiting for a mob to form outside my house with pitchforks. Luckily, none of that happened. I didn&amp;#39;t even get any weird looks when I went to the grocery store. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I checked the mailbox. There was the usual collection of bills and preapproved credit card offers promising no annual fees. There was also a flyer advertising a community event on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It mentioned the community was going to pull together and clean up the green spaces and maintain the flowerbeds. They would also be planting a community garden in the town center. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There would also be a presentation about what we could do to further reduce our carbon footprint and small things we could incorporate into our daily lives to help the environment. In all honesty it sounded boring and awful. Good thing I already had plans for my Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hidden behind the flyer was a letter. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We are watching.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Okay. So, there was this girl I used to know when I was younger (around, 12 I think) named Ava.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere was nothing wrong with Ava when I first met her. She was a normal kid; quite charming and sweet. She played with her dolls, went to the park, complained about school. You know, everything a normal kid does. But for some strange reason, she didn’t have very many friends. If I remember correctly, I seemed to be the only person she spoke to or hung out with. Reflecting on it now, the other children kind of looked…*disturbed* by her presence.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo be honest, I don’t really remember why we even started being friends in the first place. But before I knew it, we became inseparable. We always hung out at the park after school or went to the swimming pool together during the summer months. She would bring along Legos or Barbie\\'s sometimes when we went out and we would build houses and pretended to make out dolls kiss, which we both thought was gross and always joked about. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne memorable thing that I remember about Ava – the *good* thing – was that she would almost always bring me something sweet. Whether it be cupcakes, some cookies, or candy; she even brought me a whole bag of chocolate marshmallows once. At first, we would share the sweets, but she gradually began to let me have all the spoils. Which I could only assume was the first red flag. But of course, being 12, I didn’t see it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAva’s parents were wealthy, from what little she would tell me about herself. Despite these claims, though, she lived in a relatively small home on the outskirts of town. Ava’s father went out of town and her mother didn’t come home until extremely late into the night. One day, while at the park, Ava asked me to stay over a night. After some thought, I accepted, as I had nothing else to do and I was sure my dad wouldn’t mind. We arranged for me to come over that Friday. I was quite excited, but Ava was ecstatic. She went on and on the following days, saying how she had never had a sleepover before, and how we were going to have an absolute blast.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSuddenly, it was Friday. Next thing I know I’m standing on Ava’s front porch, waving as my dad drove away. I had my sleeping bag, pajamas, toothbrush, and an extra pair of clothes. The house was nice: two floors, lots of windows. It was painted a nice, bright blue. There were lush yards surrounding the home and a beautiful garden of tulips and roses and other wildflowers growing around the side. I knocked on the big double doors, still admiring the house while Ava’s footsteps sounded inside.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Hey!” she said as she opened the door, “you made it! Come on, come on, come on!” She quickly grabbed me by the elbow, picking up the duffel bag my stuff was in as she ushered me inside. The inside of the house was even better than the outside. The entrance was big, with two staircases leading up to the top floor. To the left was the entrance to what I assume was the dining room and kitchen, and to the right was an entrance to the living room. Ava quickly dragged me up the stairs on the right, leading up the second-floor hallway. There I quickly observed a bathroom.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAva quickly shoved me into what I assumed was her bedroom and practically slammed the door behind her. Her bedroom was a reasonable size as well. It was painted a nice pink, with stuffed toys neatly decorated everywhere, a dresser against one wall, and a canopy bed in the corner. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Wow. Your room is awesome, Ava!”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Thank you, really! You have a good heart.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI turned around to find her still standing behind me at her bedroom door. She was leaning against it, sort of staring at me with a weird look in her eyes. It was a faraway, dreamy stare, like a person would get when looking at their celebrity crush or something. *Okay, that’s a little weird,* I think to myself, but Ava quickly composed herself. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“So! What do you want to do first?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so, our sleepover commenced. As she had said, I had fun. We watched movies and played video games on her various consoles. She had so many stuffed toys and dolls, I didn’t even know where to start when she asked me to pick which ones I wanted to play with. Ava snuck into her parent’s room and got into her mother’s makeup drawer and did my makeup and curled my hair. We went into her kitchen and baked a whole cake and munched on ice cream and chocolate. Overall, just a nice, fun day.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen it came night, I was BEAT. I began to roll out my sleeping bag on her bedroom floor. When she saw me doing so, she immediately looked puzzled. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“What are you doing?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Setting up my sleeping bag and stuff. Why?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“What? No! You’re not sleeping on the floor! Your sleeping in my bed!”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI kind of stared at her, a little confused.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Um, what?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Yeah! You can sleep in my bed while I sleep in my mom and dad’s room!”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“No, Ava, I can’t—”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**“Your sleeping in my bed.”**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe way she said this made my skin crawl. It was deep, unfriendly voice I’d never heard before. The look she was giving me, though, is what really scared me. It was a deep, angry scowl. It almost looked like she would kill me if I slept anywhere else. The request sounded more like an order than a question, and I was too scared to argue. So, I changed into my PJ’s and climbed into her bed. If almost on cue, Ava opened the door, smiled at me, and wished me goodnight. She then turned out the light and closed the door. And by closed the door, I mean slowly close it while staring at me, still smiling creepily. I didn’t fall asleep until almost an hour later.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**\\\\***\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLoud crashing is what woke me up that night. I’m a light sleeper, so the crashing woke me instantly. I sat up in bed, wondering what had happened. Was Ava okay? As soon as I thought that, I heard footsteps on the stairs and running down the hall. Something, I don’t know what, told me that I should lay back down. So, I did. The door swung open just as I closed my eyes. I could hear the heavy breathing of what I could only assume was Ava as she approached the bed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI made myself breathe normally. Deep breath in, long breath out. It calmed my racing heart as she proceeded to sit on the edge of the bed. I then felt her hand grab my shoulder. I bit my tongue as she rolled me over. Ava then bent down and pressed her ear to my chest. Then something was dripping onto my nightshirt, and I heard a disgusting licking noise, like a dog licking its chops after it gets done eating. I heard her get up and leave, closing the door in that slow fashion she had earlier. I only opened my eyes when I heard her walk away and down the stairs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy eyes flew open and I kicked back the covers and felt all over my body. What the hell had just happened? I felt the substance on my shirt, and was quickly whisper-yelling, “Aw, ew!” as I realized it was saliva. I quickly hopped down from the bed and tiptoed to the door, slowly creaking it open and making my way down the hall. I could hear something downstairs, seemingly coming from the kitchen. I quietly made my way down the stairs, creeping through the dining room. What could Ava be doing this late at night in the first place? What had that crashing sound been? I thought these things as approached the entrance to the kitchen.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs I peered around the corner, I saw nothing out of the ordinary at first. Just her standing at the kitchen table, over an empty jar filled with what appeared to my 12-year-old mind to be lemonade. The refrigerator was wide open, but I couldn’t really see the contents as half of Ava’s body was blocking my view. I was thinking that maybe she had just gotten up to get something the drink. Lemonade was a strange choice, but I’ve drunk weirder things at night. But a cell phone on the table began vibrating, and when Ava moved to pick it up, I completely froze in absolute terror.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe contents of the fridge held Mason jars. The jars themselves were normal, filled with the same yellow liquid. But the contents were what made me nearly piss myself. In one jar, there was a pair of eyes, floating, staring at me. In another, larger container was an entire adult-sized brain. There were several other jars filled with fingers and toes. I thought I saw a liver in a box. I very nearly puked at the sight. What the fuck? What the actual *fuck?!* I then looked at the empty jar on the table and saw what Ava had been really doing. She was eating. A pair. Of *lungs.* \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Hi Mom! Yeah, I’m eating! What are you doing?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI couldn’t hear anything on the other end of the line, as I was too far away. Then again, I don’t think I would’ve wanted to know what was happening.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Yes, Mom. The lungs are being eaten. Yes, the eyes are still good.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA pause from Ava told her mother was telling her something.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“The heart? Oh, I haven’t harvested it yet. The plant is still upstairs sleeping.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI froze, an ice block of fear having lodged itself in my ribcage, where my fresh, apparently unharvested heart was beating like a drum. The conversation continued.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Yes, Mom, I’m going to do it. No, I don’t need your help, I’m not seven anymore. But Mom, it sounds *so good!* AND it’s from a good plant too, nice and young, I promise!”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt that point, I slowly backed away, and then made a mad dash back up the stairs. My mind was going a hundred thousand miles per hour. I ran into the closest room, the bathroom, and slammed the door behind me. I quickly looked around, looking for a weapon or an exit, because my stomping up the stairs had most likely alerted Ava to my presence. I found my exit in a tiny, child-sized window over the toilet. I was making my way up there just as I heard Ava on her way up the stairs. She also had something with her, as I heard it dragging behind her as she lugged it up. I heard her pass by the bathroom and slam open the door to the bedroom. She let out a bloodcurdling, inhuman shriek as she realized I wasn’t there.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI quickly managed to jimmy the window open and was beginning to shimmy my way through. On my way out, I heard crashing and wood splintering. The last thing I heard as I plummeted from the second floor was the sound of something shattering the bathroom door. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI landed on the ground with hard thud, and I heard something snap. Yep, something had broken, but I had no time to check what. So, in pajamas and bare feet, I booked it from the house, running in the direction of town. Every now and then I checked over my shoulder to see if Ava was following me, but I only saw her when the house was becoming a dot in the distance. She was standing on her front porch, staring after me. And, from what I could see, she was carrying an axe.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt wasn’t until I couldn’t even see the house that I felt safe enough to call my dad. I told him everything, and 20 minutes later he was loading me in the car and calling the police. I was in the hospital for a while with a fractured elbow, two broken ribs, and a twisted ankle.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI wasn’t told what happened to Ava until I was older. When the police arrive, Ava had disappeared. They did find all the body part and organs, though. They tested them and concluded them to be their neighbors. Since they lived out in the middle of nowhere, I guess they assumed they would go unnoticed if they killed them. They also told my dad that the sweets were to most likely \"fatten me up.\" The police never actually found Ava or her parents, and I never saw Ava again. And I never went over to people houses, ever again.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo this day, whenever I go to sleep, I can hear that axe dragging up the stairs. I can still see that crazy grin. I can still feel her spit dripping on my shirt.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI can still see her standing on the porch, staring after me with those hungry eyes.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay. So, there was this girl I used to know when I was younger (around, 12 I think) named Ava.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was nothing wrong with Ava when I first met her. She was a normal kid; quite charming and sweet. She played with her dolls, went to the park, complained about school. You know, everything a normal kid does. But for some strange reason, she didn’t have very many friends. If I remember correctly, I seemed to be the only person she spoke to or hung out with. Reflecting on it now, the other children kind of looked…&lt;em&gt;disturbed&lt;/em&gt; by her presence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t really remember why we even started being friends in the first place. But before I knew it, we became inseparable. We always hung out at the park after school or went to the swimming pool together during the summer months. She would bring along Legos or Barbie&amp;#39;s sometimes when we went out and we would build houses and pretended to make out dolls kiss, which we both thought was gross and always joked about. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One memorable thing that I remember about Ava – the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing – was that she would almost always bring me something sweet. Whether it be cupcakes, some cookies, or candy; she even brought me a whole bag of chocolate marshmallows once. At first, we would share the sweets, but she gradually began to let me have all the spoils. Which I could only assume was the first red flag. But of course, being 12, I didn’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ava’s parents were wealthy, from what little she would tell me about herself. Despite these claims, though, she lived in a relatively small home on the outskirts of town. Ava’s father went out of town and her mother didn’t come home until extremely late into the night. One day, while at the park, Ava asked me to stay over a night. After some thought, I accepted, as I had nothing else to do and I was sure my dad wouldn’t mind. We arranged for me to come over that Friday. I was quite excited, but Ava was ecstatic. She went on and on the following days, saying how she had never had a sleepover before, and how we were going to have an absolute blast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it was Friday. Next thing I know I’m standing on Ava’s front porch, waving as my dad drove away. I had my sleeping bag, pajamas, toothbrush, and an extra pair of clothes. The house was nice: two floors, lots of windows. It was painted a nice, bright blue. There were lush yards surrounding the home and a beautiful garden of tulips and roses and other wildflowers growing around the side. I knocked on the big double doors, still admiring the house while Ava’s footsteps sounded inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey!” she said as she opened the door, “you made it! Come on, come on, come on!” She quickly grabbed me by the elbow, picking up the duffel bag my stuff was in as she ushered me inside. The inside of the house was even better than the outside. The entrance was big, with two staircases leading up to the top floor. To the left was the entrance to what I assume was the dining room and kitchen, and to the right was an entrance to the living room. Ava quickly dragged me up the stairs on the right, leading up the second-floor hallway. There I quickly observed a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ava quickly shoved me into what I assumed was her bedroom and practically slammed the door behind her. Her bedroom was a reasonable size as well. It was painted a nice pink, with stuffed toys neatly decorated everywhere, a dresser against one wall, and a canopy bed in the corner. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wow. Your room is awesome, Ava!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, really! You have a good heart.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around to find her still standing behind me at her bedroom door. She was leaning against it, sort of staring at me with a weird look in her eyes. It was a faraway, dreamy stare, like a person would get when looking at their celebrity crush or something. &lt;em&gt;Okay, that’s a little weird,&lt;/em&gt; I think to myself, but Ava quickly composed herself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So! What do you want to do first?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And so, our sleepover commenced. As she had said, I had fun. We watched movies and played video games on her various consoles. She had so many stuffed toys and dolls, I didn’t even know where to start when she asked me to pick which ones I wanted to play with. Ava snuck into her parent’s room and got into her mother’s makeup drawer and did my makeup and curled my hair. We went into her kitchen and baked a whole cake and munched on ice cream and chocolate. Overall, just a nice, fun day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When it came night, I was BEAT. I began to roll out my sleeping bag on her bedroom floor. When she saw me doing so, she immediately looked puzzled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Setting up my sleeping bag and stuff. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What? No! You’re not sleeping on the floor! Your sleeping in my bed!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of stared at her, a little confused.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Um, what?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah! You can sleep in my bed while I sleep in my mom and dad’s room!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, Ava, I can’t—”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Your sleeping in my bed.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The way she said this made my skin crawl. It was deep, unfriendly voice I’d never heard before. The look she was giving me, though, is what really scared me. It was a deep, angry scowl. It almost looked like she would kill me if I slept anywhere else. The request sounded more like an order than a question, and I was too scared to argue. So, I changed into my PJ’s and climbed into her bed. If almost on cue, Ava opened the door, smiled at me, and wished me goodnight. She then turned out the light and closed the door. And by closed the door, I mean slowly close it while staring at me, still smiling creepily. I didn’t fall asleep until almost an hour later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\\\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Loud crashing is what woke me up that night. I’m a light sleeper, so the crashing woke me instantly. I sat up in bed, wondering what had happened. Was Ava okay? As soon as I thought that, I heard footsteps on the stairs and running down the hall. Something, I don’t know what, told me that I should lay back down. So, I did. The door swung open just as I closed my eyes. I could hear the heavy breathing of what I could only assume was Ava as she approached the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I made myself breathe normally. Deep breath in, long breath out. It calmed my racing heart as she proceeded to sit on the edge of the bed. I then felt her hand grab my shoulder. I bit my tongue as she rolled me over. Ava then bent down and pressed her ear to my chest. Then something was dripping onto my nightshirt, and I heard a disgusting licking noise, like a dog licking its chops after it gets done eating. I heard her get up and leave, closing the door in that slow fashion she had earlier. I only opened my eyes when I heard her walk away and down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes flew open and I kicked back the covers and felt all over my body. What the hell had just happened? I felt the substance on my shirt, and was quickly whisper-yelling, “Aw, ew!” as I realized it was saliva. I quickly hopped down from the bed and tiptoed to the door, slowly creaking it open and making my way down the hall. I could hear something downstairs, seemingly coming from the kitchen. I quietly made my way down the stairs, creeping through the dining room. What could Ava be doing this late at night in the first place? What had that crashing sound been? I thought these things as approached the entrance to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I peered around the corner, I saw nothing out of the ordinary at first. Just her standing at the kitchen table, over an empty jar filled with what appeared to my 12-year-old mind to be lemonade. The refrigerator was wide open, but I couldn’t really see the contents as half of Ava’s body was blocking my view. I was thinking that maybe she had just gotten up to get something the drink. Lemonade was a strange choice, but I’ve drunk weirder things at night. But a cell phone on the table began vibrating, and when Ava moved to pick it up, I completely froze in absolute terror.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The contents of the fridge held Mason jars. The jars themselves were normal, filled with the same yellow liquid. But the contents were what made me nearly piss myself. In one jar, there was a pair of eyes, floating, staring at me. In another, larger container was an entire adult-sized brain. There were several other jars filled with fingers and toes. I thought I saw a liver in a box. I very nearly puked at the sight. What the fuck? What the actual &lt;em&gt;fuck?!&lt;/em&gt; I then looked at the empty jar on the table and saw what Ava had been really doing. She was eating. A pair. Of &lt;em&gt;lungs.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi Mom! Yeah, I’m eating! What are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t hear anything on the other end of the line, as I was too far away. Then again, I don’t think I would’ve wanted to know what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Mom. The lungs are being eaten. Yes, the eyes are still good.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A pause from Ava told her mother was telling her something.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The heart? Oh, I haven’t harvested it yet. The plant is still upstairs sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I froze, an ice block of fear having lodged itself in my ribcage, where my fresh, apparently unharvested heart was beating like a drum. The conversation continued.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Mom, I’m going to do it. No, I don’t need your help, I’m not seven anymore. But Mom, it sounds &lt;em&gt;so good!&lt;/em&gt; AND it’s from a good plant too, nice and young, I promise!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, I slowly backed away, and then made a mad dash back up the stairs. My mind was going a hundred thousand miles per hour. I ran into the closest room, the bathroom, and slammed the door behind me. I quickly looked around, looking for a weapon or an exit, because my stomping up the stairs had most likely alerted Ava to my presence. I found my exit in a tiny, child-sized window over the toilet. I was making my way up there just as I heard Ava on her way up the stairs. She also had something with her, as I heard it dragging behind her as she lugged it up. I heard her pass by the bathroom and slam open the door to the bedroom. She let out a bloodcurdling, inhuman shriek as she realized I wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly managed to jimmy the window open and was beginning to shimmy my way through. On my way out, I heard crashing and wood splintering. The last thing I heard as I plummeted from the second floor was the sound of something shattering the bathroom door. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I landed on the ground with hard thud, and I heard something snap. Yep, something had broken, but I had no time to check what. So, in pajamas and bare feet, I booked it from the house, running in the direction of town. Every now and then I checked over my shoulder to see if Ava was following me, but I only saw her when the house was becoming a dot in the distance. She was standing on her front porch, staring after me. And, from what I could see, she was carrying an axe.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I couldn’t even see the house that I felt safe enough to call my dad. I told him everything, and 20 minutes later he was loading me in the car and calling the police. I was in the hospital for a while with a fractured elbow, two broken ribs, and a twisted ankle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t told what happened to Ava until I was older. When the police arrive, Ava had disappeared. They did find all the body part and organs, though. They tested them and concluded them to be their neighbors. Since they lived out in the middle of nowhere, I guess they assumed they would go unnoticed if they killed them. They also told my dad that the sweets were to most likely &amp;quot;fatten me up.&amp;quot; The police never actually found Ava or her parents, and I never saw Ava again. And I never went over to people houses, ever again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To this day, whenever I go to sleep, I can hear that axe dragging up the stairs. I can still see that crazy grin. I can still feel her spit dripping on my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can still see her standing on the porch, staring after me with those hungry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

This is the only name that matters right now, and that is the name of the being that has sealed my fate.\\n\\nMe?\\n\\nI’m not a normal guy.\\xa0\\n\\nI was always known as the person that had unending potential, but for some reason, I always managed to make spontaneous decisions that would somehow fuck up everything good going for me at that time.\\xa0\\n\\nLove, happiness, friends, and family, I burned all of those bridges. It’s not that I wanted to, it’s because, for some reason, I am afraid of having anything positive going on in my life. For me, if anything is going right, it’s fake and I should get rid of it as soon as possible. It all just feels fake to me.\\xa0\\n\\nI didn’t think there was any hope for me. I mean, I’ve actually come to peace with it.\\n\\nTwenty-six years old, with no one close to me, a job that I barely like, and a small apartment that seems barely livable. I had a cat for a couple of years, but about six months ago he ran away. I never bothered trying to get another pet after that.\\n\\nI was close to someone for a long time. It was my uncle. He was the one that made me fall in love with classical literature, taught me how to fish, introduced me to movies that even to this day, I watch whenever I get the chance to.\\xa0\\n\\nHe was the only family I ever had, but just like everything good in my life that I held onto, I lost him. He died in a car accident. The other driver was triple the alcohol limit.\\n\\nFor the last couple of years I have lived a mostly secluded life. The only interactions being with coworkers, just about work, nothing personal.\\xa0\\n\\nI tried dating a couple of times. There were a few that definitely captured my interest, but in the end, it would just cease after a couple of weeks. Their lives just didn’t match mine. People my age want to go out. Hang out with their friends, go to bars, and in general, be social.\\xa0\\n\\nI first heard about *Xinefra* a couple of weeks ago. Two of my coworkers were talking about it while they were pointing at a juvenile looking news article they found on Facebook.\\xa0 At that time, I just scoffed at the idea of it.\\n\\nBasically what the article stated was that, Xinefra was a being that was able to grant a person any sort of change they wanted in their life. It couldn’t be something completely ridiculous, it couldn’t make you super smart or rich, but instead, it could change a part of your personality. Like all “rituals” there were consequences if they were not successful with the complete ritual.\\xa0\\n\\nIf it ended with a success, you were granted with the gift of change, but if you failed, you had four days before *Xinefra* takes over your body. Your spirit will start to slowly diminish away from your body, and it wouldn’t take long before you lose your body completely. Your spirit being thrown to whatever pit *Xinefra* wants to dispose of your soul.\\n\\nLike everyone that posts on Nosleep, curiosity started to get the better of me.\\xa0\\n\\nIt wasn’t long before I looked up what the requirements for the ritual was.\\n\\nUnlike most rituals I have heard of before, this did not require anything. It was just a simple phrase that you had to keep repeating. However, there was one catch, the spirit will come out when you least expect it.\\xa0\\n\\nThe spirit will be the embodiment of your greatest fear, and when *Xinefra* reveals himself, you cannot stutter or stop. You have to keep repeating the phrase until he allows you to stop. There were several blogs of people that have tried the ritual, and none of them seemed to agree on how many times you were to repeat the phrase before it would allow you to stop and tell him what change you desire.\\n\\nThere were some blogs that said they failed the ritual. Some continued to add to their blog, but none of them lasted longer than four days after. Which is why I guess everyone assumed you had four days before you completely lost your soul.\\n\\nThe ritual can take place at any time, at any location, and by any person, but it is suggested that you are in a place where there are minimal distractions.\\n\\n*A price for a change. A soul for you to feast. Xinefra, take another soul, and give me the change.*\\n\\nThe phrase was simple. Simple enough to sound fake, but shit, after thinking about it until last night, I figured there wasn’t much to lose.\\n\\nThat’s where I fucked up.\\xa0\\n\\nI did it around ten at night, there wasn’t anything to distract me, and I was sitting on my couch. I was as ready as I could be. I just didn’t expect the form that Xinefra would approach me with.\\n\\nI said the phrase around seven times before the room turned musky, I started to sweat when my uncle came out from the wall to the right of me. He had the dead bodies of my mother and father in each of his hands.\\n\\nWhile I continued to repeat the phrase, the form of my uncle gave me a sly smile before he began to whisper, *”You trusted me. I always told you that everything I did for you, was good for you. You are like me, and that is why you push everyone away. You know that people like you and I are always going to remain the same. We love people so much, we want them to only be ours. You are jealous, when they start getting closer to others, you will do whatever you need to do to keep them close to you. You were always like a son to me. That’s why I did what I had to do.”*\\n\\nHe was only halfway through what he was saying before I lost track, and I stopped repeating the phrase. I just stared at my uncle’s form until he finished what he was saying.\\n\\nHe was right. I was foolish to think I could change.\\n\\nI failed the challenge, but hey, you’re probably not like me. Maybe you have a chance with making a better change for yourself.\\n\\nSo repeat after me, and don’t stop repeating it until *Xinefra* gives you permission to stop.\\n\\n*A price for a change. A soul for you to feast. Xinefra, take another soul, and give me the change.*',\n",

It’s not that I wanted to, it’s because, for some reason, I am afraid of having anything positive going on in my life.

I mean, I’ve actually come to peace with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six years old, with no one close to me, a job that I barely like, and a small apartment that seems barely livable. I had a cat for a couple of years, but about six months ago he ran away. I never bothered trying to get another pet after that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was close to someone for a long time. It was my uncle. He was the one that made me fall in love with classical literature, taught me how to fish, introduced me to movies that even to this day, I watch whenever I get the chance to.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was the only family I ever had, but just like everything good in my life that I held onto, I lost him. He died in a car accident. The other driver was triple the alcohol limit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I have lived a mostly secluded life. The only interactions being with coworkers, just about work, nothing personal.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tried dating a couple of times. There were a few that definitely captured my interest, but in the end, it would just cease after a couple of weeks. Their lives just didn’t match mine. People my age want to go out.

       "   'selftext': 'It had been around 4:00 AM on a Wednesday when the first birds had fallen from the sky.\\n\\nI had been sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee while leafing through the morning papers when a sudden impact at the window had startled me out of my early morning stupor, spilling my drink on my leg. As I had leapt up, the heat searing through my clothes to my skin, it had been followed by another bang on the glass.\\n\\nThen came another. And another. And another.\\n\\nTheir tiny bodies had bounced off the tops of parked cars, the impact setting off the high -pitched alarms, or become entangled in overhead telephone wires, thudding off the nearby roofs before rolling into the gutters and on the fresh cut lawns.\\n\\nBy the time I had made it outside, their tiny dark forms blanketed every conceivable surface as far as the eye could see, turning a peaceful suburban neighbourhood into an avian mass suicide spot. Most were dead, but there were some still alive amongst the masses, their feathered bodies writhing in agony, as if their muscles were being stimulated by electricity.\\n\\nOver a hundred starlings- all dead.\\n\\nAs we soon found out, it hadn’t been just our neighbourhood. All over the town, birds had simply just stopped flying and dropped down dead. The streets were soon lined with bio-hazard trucks, filled with men in white suits who sealed off the streets to collect the bodies. The survivors had been taken to local bird centres, only to perish soon afterwards.\\n\\nRumours rebounded throughout the town. Some spoke of chem-trails that were poisoning the skies. Others believed it to be a new strain of bird flu and took to wearing face masks. The religious types flocked to the churches, proclaiming the incident to be an impending sign of the apocalypse.\\n\\nMike, our local homeless man, had a different theory.\\n\\n“The sky people done it,” He’d proclaimed to anyone who’d listen, \"they gonna take us up for all our sins.\"\\n\\nThen he gave a giving a brown-toothed, rotted grin before returning to swig his brown paper-wrapped wine bottle.\\n\\nOf course, his words went unnoticed. I was one of the few who kept an ear out to his ramblings, even talked to him and offered some money. But Mike had no desire to better his life. He was comfortable being a fixture of the streets.\\n\\nIn all the chaos, I’d tried to be rational about it all. Shortly after it had happened, I’d started researching about it and discovered that it wasn’t as uncommon as I thought it was. It happened for a variety of reasons- poisonings, lack of food, pollution. It happened so often that it had a name- bird kill. A helicopter sweep over the area revealed the phenomenon to be relegated to our area. There weren’t any reports of it happening anywhere else in the county. It was just something that happened in nature, that was beyond the scope of human comprehension.\\n\\nIt still didn’t stop me from being more than a little unnerved by it all.\\n\\nEven when the streets were clear again, something clung in the air, refusing to sift. People were afraid.\\n\\nSuch fears would turn out to be warranted.\\n\\nIt happened a month after the ‘fall’, when everything was starting to settle back into a state of almost-normality. I had just returned from work, collapsing onto the sofa. Just as I was about to fetch myself a well-deserved beer from the fridge, a sudden crack of glass drew my attention to the shuttered windows.\\n\\nA large crack descended vertically down the side of the pane. But that was the least of my worries when I noticed the trickle of blood. Rushing outside, I saw a pale body crumpled below my window.\\n\\nI saw my darkened reflection in the lifeless, beaded eyes of a goose, wings splayed across the grass. Blood seeped down its bill from the ceramic tile splinter embedded in its forehead from colliding into my roof. Stray white feathers ghosted around my feet, its beak open in what looked like a silent scream, as if it had seen something terrible before it fell from the sky.\\n\\nI heard a phlegm-soaked chuckle from the corner of the street. Mike sat half-hidden in his cardboard box, staring out at the piling bodies, his greasy auburn beard bristling under his immense grin. His half-clouded eyes met mine and a knot seemed to form in my throat.\\n\\n“Not long now, boy,” he cackled in a mocking singsong, “not long now.”\\n\\nJust as cryptically as he’d come, he’d scuttled back into the safety of his makeshift home.\\n\\nAs you might have guessed, it wasn’t the only one.\\n\\nThe bodies of at least 30 geese were recovered that day. The local authorities explained it off as an ‘unexplained disturbance’ in the magnetic field that had thrown off a migrating flock, but the previous incident was all too fresh in the minds of everyone else for it them to consider it just coincidence.\\n\\nThe dip in my roof from where its body had hit served as a permanent reminder, as it did for many of my neighbours.\\n\\nThe damages caused totalled almost several thousand dollars. It raised public debate in our town over the safety of the pesticides that farmers were applying to their fields, which some believed to be the cause of the phenomena- that it had somehow become airborne. Starlings were a common pest in our town, and it seemed the most likely explanation. But some turned to wilder theories- that it was the result of aliens or a virus that had been engineered by the government and released into the local water supply.\\n\\nPeople started stocking up on bottled water and avoiding consuming certain local products. Neighbours would huddle together in their doorways, seeking solace in their shared fear. Their low, panicked whispers would drift into my ears whenever I walked past. Their conjecture didn’t affect me. When you live alone for so long, you tend to trust your own opinion and I just thought it was one of those once -in -a -blue -moon type occurrences, something that incurred a morbid fascination, but would probably never happen again in nature.\\n\\nI was both wrong and right.\\n\\nOne of my neighbours, Mrs. Cárdenas, had opened her door one morning, expecting her three-year old tabby, Abilio, to stroll in as usual for his morning bowl of cat food. When he failed to show up, it was enough to send her out into the neighbourhood searching for him, still bundled in her dressing gown.\\n\\nThe sound of her scream is something that neither I, nor anyone else in the neighbourhood will ever forget.\\n\\nI had rushed out of my house, trying to track down the noise. I was already on the line with 911 when I found her crumpled to the ground, her face in her hands and half-hysterical. The rollers pinning back her hair had come undone, sending greying strands of dark hair falling over her face.\\n\\nI gingerly sat down beside her, trying to remember all the rudimentary Spanish I’d learnt from high school to try and ask her what was wrong.\\n\\nShe had lifted her head from her hands, her face slick with tears. Then, with a trembling finger, she pointed upwards.\\n\\nMy eyes squinted up to a nearby transformer, making out a small shape at the very top, higher than I knew where any human could reach, was something that hadn’t been there the day before. Looking closer, I realised it was Abilio.\\n\\nOr rather, what remained of him.\\n\\nHe\\'d been impaled through the structure, his limp body dangling backwards with his paws splayed outwards, as if he’d been dropped from a significant height. Every few seconds, his tiny corpse would slide a few inches further down with a gelatinous squelch of innards. His intestines were draped around the metal like some demented May pole.\\n\\nI could only stare up as Mrs. Cárdenas continued to sob into my shoulder, her tears soaking through the sleeve of my shirt.\\n\\nHe was one of the few bodies we were able to find. The rest just disappeared without a trace, as if sucked into the sky.\\n\\nThe severed wings of birds started appearing on our roofs- no bodies, just the wings. There weren’t any tooth marks on them indicating any animal had been responsible. The cuts were so clean that it was like it had been done with a bladed instrument.\\n\\nAfter that, signs began appearing in the front yards and windows of my neighbours, bright bold type printed across the front for all to see- ‘FOR SALE’. Soon, the windows that once glowed bright with parties, book clubs and muffled, every day chattered were silent and empty, left to gather dust. People didn’t feel safe living here anymore.\\n\\nI’ve stood by and watched it all happen. But I can’t ignore what I saw last night. It’s why I’m writing this- to warn others of what’s out there.\\n\\nIt was during a particularly intense thunderstorm, that I had decided to go down and get a drink of water storm. The rumbling thunder had made it impossible to sleep, so I had decided to slip a NyQuil in and hope for the best.\\n\\nAs I was standing at the kitchen sink, glass in hand and staring out the window at the droplets pattering against the glass, a crack of lightning illuminated the billowing clouds outside, if just for a split second.\\n\\nThere were the silhouettes of three, unmistakably humanoid figures behind the cover of the storm clouds, just floating there. There were no wings or machinery that seemed to be keeping them airborne. They just stood, hanging hundreds of feet in the air, overlooking over the rows of houses.\\n\\nI know that I wasn’t hallucinating. I hadn’t even taken the sleeping pills yet, and their shapes were just too solid to be just a trick of the light.\\n\\nI haven’t seen Mike for the past couple of days. I want to believe that he found somewhere to stay, maybe even sorted his life out. I wish I’d listened to him when I had the chance. But I know what’s out there now and I’ve seen what they’re capable of.\\n\\nSoon it won’t just be the birds anymore.\\n\\nThis is only the beginning of something far worse. They’re out there, higher than we can ever see. I’m writing this as a warning, to any who will listen- stay indoors, especially at night. If you must go out, try to be as brief as possible and don’t look up. If you hear strange sounds on your roof, don’t try to investigate. Keep your pets inside.\\n\\nAbove all, fear the skies.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been around 4:00 AM on a Wednesday when the first birds had fallen from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had been sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee while leafing through the morning papers when a sudden impact at the window had startled me out of my early morning stupor, spilling my drink on my leg. As I had leapt up, the heat searing through my clothes to my skin, it had been followed by another bang on the glass.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then came another. And another. And another.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Their tiny bodies had bounced off the tops of parked cars, the impact setting off the high -pitched alarms, or become entangled in overhead telephone wires, thudding off the nearby roofs before rolling into the gutters and on the fresh cut lawns.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I had made it outside, their tiny dark forms blanketed every conceivable surface as far as the eye could see, turning a peaceful suburban neighbourhood into an avian mass suicide spot. Most were dead, but there were some still alive amongst the masses, their feathered bodies writhing in agony, as if their muscles were being stimulated by electricity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over a hundred starlings- all dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As we soon found out, it hadn’t been just our neighbourhood. All over the town, birds had simply just stopped flying and dropped down dead. The streets were soon lined with bio-hazard trucks, filled with men in white suits who sealed off the streets to collect the bodies. The survivors had been taken to local bird centres, only to perish soon afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rumours rebounded throughout the town. Some spoke of chem-trails that were poisoning the skies. Others believed it to be a new strain of bird flu and took to wearing face masks. The religious types flocked to the churches, proclaiming the incident to be an impending sign of the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mike, our local homeless man, had a different theory.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The sky people done it,” He’d proclaimed to anyone who’d listen, &amp;quot;they gonna take us up for all our sins.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then he gave a giving a brown-toothed, rotted grin before returning to swig his brown paper-wrapped wine bottle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, his words went unnoticed. I was one of the few who kept an ear out to his ramblings, even talked to him and offered some money. But Mike had no desire to better his life. He was comfortable being a fixture of the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In all the chaos, I’d tried to be rational about it all. Shortly after it had happened, I’d started researching about it and discovered that it wasn’t as uncommon as I thought it was. It happened for a variety of reasons- poisonings, lack of food, pollution. It happened so often that it had a name- bird kill. A helicopter sweep over the area revealed the phenomenon to be relegated to our area. There weren’t any reports of it happening anywhere else in the county. It was just something that happened in nature, that was beyond the scope of human comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It still didn’t stop me from being more than a little unnerved by it all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even when the streets were clear again, something clung in the air, refusing to sift. People were afraid.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Such fears would turn out to be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It happened a month after the ‘fall’, when everything was starting to settle back into a state of almost-normality. I had just returned from work, collapsing onto the sofa. Just as I was about to fetch myself a well-deserved beer from the fridge, a sudden crack of glass drew my attention to the shuttered windows.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A large crack descended vertically down the side of the pane. But that was the least of my worries when I noticed the trickle of blood. Rushing outside, I saw a pale body crumpled below my window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I saw my darkened reflection in the lifeless, beaded eyes of a goose, wings splayed across the grass. Blood seeped down its bill from the ceramic tile splinter embedded in its forehead from colliding into my roof. Stray white feathers ghosted around my feet, its beak open in what looked like a silent scream, as if it had seen something terrible before it fell from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heard a phlegm-soaked chuckle from the corner of the street. Mike sat half-hidden in his cardboard box, staring out at the piling bodies, his greasy auburn beard bristling under his immense grin. His half-clouded eyes met mine and a knot seemed to form in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Not long now, boy,” he cackled in a mocking singsong, “not long now.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just as cryptically as he’d come, he’d scuttled back into the safety of his makeshift home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, it wasn’t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bodies of at least 30 geese were recovered that day. The local authorities explained it off as an ‘unexplained disturbance’ in the magnetic field that had thrown off a migrating flock, but the previous incident was all too fresh in the minds of everyone else for it them to consider it just coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dip in my roof from where its body had hit served as a permanent reminder, as it did for many of my neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The damages caused totalled almost several thousand dollars. It raised public debate in our town over the safety of the pesticides that farmers were applying to their fields, which some believed to be the cause of the phenomena- that it had somehow become airborne. Starlings were a common pest in our town, and it seemed the most likely explanation. But some turned to wilder theories- that it was the result of aliens or a virus that had been engineered by the government and released into the local water supply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;People started stocking up on bottled water and avoiding consuming certain local products. Neighbours would huddle together in their doorways, seeking solace in their shared fear. Their low, panicked whispers would drift into my ears whenever I walked past. Their conjecture didn’t affect me. When you live alone for so long, you tend to trust your own opinion and I just thought it was one of those once -in -a -blue -moon type occurrences, something that incurred a morbid fascination, but would probably never happen again in nature.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was both wrong and right.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of my neighbours, Mrs. Cárdenas, had opened her door one morning, expecting her three-year old tabby, Abilio, to stroll in as usual for his morning bowl of cat food. When he failed to show up, it was enough to send her out into the neighbourhood searching for him, still bundled in her dressing gown.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sound of her scream is something that neither I, nor anyone else in the neighbourhood will ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had rushed out of my house, trying to track down the noise. I was already on the line with 911 when I found her crumpled to the ground, her face in her hands and half-hysterical. The rollers pinning back her hair had come undone, sending greying strands of dark hair falling over her face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I gingerly sat down beside her, trying to remember all the rudimentary Spanish I’d learnt from high school to try and ask her what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She had lifted her head from her hands, her face slick with tears. Then, with a trembling finger, she pointed upwards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes squinted up to a nearby transformer, making out a small shape at the very top, higher than I knew where any human could reach, was something that hadn’t been there the day before. Looking closer, I realised it was Abilio.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Or rather, what remained of him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d been impaled through the structure, his limp body dangling backwards with his paws splayed outwards, as if he’d been dropped from a significant height. Every few seconds, his tiny corpse would slide a few inches further down with a gelatinous squelch of innards. His intestines were draped around the metal like some demented May pole.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could only stare up as Mrs. Cárdenas continued to sob into my shoulder, her tears soaking through the sleeve of my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was one of the few bodies we were able to find. The rest just disappeared without a trace, as if sucked into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The severed wings of birds started appearing on our roofs- no bodies, just the wings. There weren’t any tooth marks on them indicating any animal had been responsible. The cuts were so clean that it was like it had been done with a bladed instrument.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After that, signs began appearing in the front yards and windows of my neighbours, bright bold type printed across the front for all to see- ‘FOR SALE’. Soon, the windows that once glowed bright with parties, book clubs and muffled, every day chattered were silent and empty, left to gather dust. People didn’t feel safe living here anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve stood by and watched it all happen. But I can’t ignore what I saw last night. It’s why I’m writing this- to warn others of what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was during a particularly intense thunderstorm, that I had decided to go down and get a drink of water storm. The rumbling thunder had made it impossible to sleep, so I had decided to slip a NyQuil in and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I was standing at the kitchen sink, glass in hand and staring out the window at the droplets pattering against the glass, a crack of lightning illuminated the billowing clouds outside, if just for a split second.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were the silhouettes of three, unmistakably humanoid figures behind the cover of the storm clouds, just floating there. There were no wings or machinery that seemed to be keeping them airborne. They just stood, hanging hundreds of feet in the air, overlooking over the rows of houses.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know that I wasn’t hallucinating. I hadn’t even taken the sleeping pills yet, and their shapes were just too solid to be just a trick of the light.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen Mike for the past couple of days. I want to believe that he found somewhere to stay, maybe even sorted his life out. I wish I’d listened to him when I had the chance. But I know what’s out there now and I’ve seen what they’re capable of.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Soon it won’t just be the birds anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is only the beginning of something far worse. They’re out there, higher than we can ever see. I’m writing this as a warning, to any who will listen- stay indoors, especially at night. If you must go out, try to be as brief as possible and don’t look up. If you hear strange sounds on your roof, don’t try to investigate. Keep your pets inside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Above all, fear the skies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
