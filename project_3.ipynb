       "   'selftext': 'So, a little backstory. \\n\\nI’m 46 years old and live in (what used to be) Tennessee. I grew up in Tennessee, and my parents were hardcore on Catholicism. My dad always said the end times would arrive soon, and because of this, we had a little bunker built out of metal for the ‘apocalypse’. So fast forward a couple decades, and my parents eventually both pass away. My mom went peacefully in her sleep, but my dad didn’t. He had a seizure and was rushed to the hospital, and the whole time he was screaming about the end times and how everyone would die. The last thing he asked me to do was keep the bunker ‘alive’ and to stay and make sure it was ok.\\n\\nHe died of a stroke later that day.\\n\\nSo long story short, I moved back into my childhood home, and it seemed a lot smaller then I remembered. I did what my dad asked, keeping the bunker tidy and well stocked. We had enough food and water for 4 years and I always thought it was the dumbest thing in the world, but I wanted to respect my dad’s wishes. Especially since he died so brutally.\\n\\nA few years go by and I’m still living in my dad’s house. Still tidying the bunker, still mourning their losses. When one day, on March 15th, 2011, I was eating my cereal and toast when I saw a Breaking News headline pop on the TV.  I can’t remember exactly what it said, but it was something about an unknown force causing people to kill everyone around them. I dropped my toast and felt out of breath. My vision tunneled and my heart rate spiked. The scientists on the TV said that some kind of energy beam was shot at us through space, and if you looked at it, you’d go insane.\\n\\nMy mind whirled with thoughts. Was my dad right? No, this must have been a prank. But I have no one who knows me well. Who would do this? Why? What is that beam? \\n\\nI decided to heed my dad’s advice. I ran downstairs, shutting all my windows and doors, and locked the metal door. \\n\\nI stayed down there for 5 years. I stretched my food rations as much as possible. I never wanted to leave. I hadn’t talked to anyone for 5 years, either. It made me crazy. It had been 8 days since I ate. I ran out of water the day before I did it. I didn’t want to go out. But I also didn’t want to starve. So, that’s why on April 6th, 2016, I opened that rusty old steel door. And what I saw confused me.\\n\\nNothing had changed. At least, not immediately. My house looked- clean. Cleaner than I imagined. Cleaner than I remembered. No dust or anything. \\n\\nAm I dead? I thought. Is this purgatory or something? \\n\\nI was looking around when I saw something that made my blood curdle. It was my TV, still on. I was so confused. It was playing something about a Mississippi Governor signing a controversial religion law. \\n\\nAnd the weirdest part about it? It wasn’t the channel I left it on. \\n\\nI was looking outside, and I almost passed out when I saw the grass. It was like little green spikes, all over the place. That’s not what grass looks like. Grass is circular, like flowers. They look like little disks. Not spikes. \\n\\nSome other things were off as well. Tree bark looked tougher. It hurt to look directly at the sun. The clouds were whiter, rather than the yellowish ones I was used to. Everything seemed a bit off, and just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, I walked through the front door. No, not me. Someone else with my body. I stared at them. They didn’t see me at first. But they did eventually. We both froze. \\n\\nI ran out of the house. I ran all the way down to the police station to see what was going on. I told them everything, and they asked me to calm down and to follow them into the back. I did, and they sat me down and told me to wait. An hour or so passed, and someone came in who looked like they worked for the government. They asked me tell them my story, so I did. \\n\\nHe then explained what happened. \\n\\nOn March 16th, 2011, a being above ours shot an energy beam at Earth. Almost everyone was obliterated. The remaining few people (who mostly were part of the government) decided to create genetic copies of everyone and put them in a simulation of our world. Everyone who died. The simulation wasn’t perfect, it had a few glitches, but it held up. This simulation of us surrounded our normal world, so we couldn’t tell the difference. It’s a hologram. Now of course, not everyone who survived the explosion liked this plan. Around 200,000 people, in fact. And the higher-ups killed them all. Their deaths were blamed by the Syrian Civil War inside the simulation. \\n\\nThe man I was talking to said he was one of the survivors, simply being transported here temporarily to talk to me. He said that he would have my copy neutralized, and that if I didn’t tell anyone about this, I could pretend to be him and live out the rest of ‘my’ life. But it’s not my life.\\n\\nAnd neither is yours. You’re a clone, a copy, of someone who died in 2011. \\n\\nAnd you stole their life.\\n\\nThe real world has curved grass. And yellow clouds. And the sun isn’t so bright. And the trees are smoother. \\n\\nAnd most importantly, the real world has the real you. The dead you.\\n\\nYou’re an echo of yourself. You won’t believe this, I know that, but I want you to do something.\\n\\nThe next time you’re looking for your phone and it’s suddenly in your hand, think. Was it really there a second ago? \\n\\nIf not, well, you’re just proving my point. You don’t exist. \\n\\nNothing does.\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\n(Edit) Spelling',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, a little backstory. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m 46 years old and live in (what used to be) Tennessee. I grew up in Tennessee, and my parents were hardcore on Catholicism. My dad always said the end times would arrive soon, and because of this, we had a little bunker built out of metal for the ‘apocalypse’. So fast forward a couple decades, and my parents eventually both pass away. My mom went peacefully in her sleep, but my dad didn’t. He had a seizure and was rushed to the hospital, and the whole time he was screaming about the end times and how everyone would die. The last thing he asked me to do was keep the bunker ‘alive’ and to stay and make sure it was ok.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He died of a stroke later that day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So long story short, I moved back into my childhood home, and it seemed a lot smaller then I remembered. I did what my dad asked, keeping the bunker tidy and well stocked. We had enough food and water for 4 years and I always thought it was the dumbest thing in the world, but I wanted to respect my dad’s wishes. Especially since he died so brutally.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A few years go by and I’m still living in my dad’s house. Still tidying the bunker, still mourning their losses. When one day, on March 15th, 2011, I was eating my cereal and toast when I saw a Breaking News headline pop on the TV.  I can’t remember exactly what it said, but it was something about an unknown force causing people to kill everyone around them. I dropped my toast and felt out of breath. My vision tunneled and my heart rate spiked. The scientists on the TV said that some kind of energy beam was shot at us through space, and if you looked at it, you’d go insane.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mind whirled with thoughts. Was my dad right? No, this must have been a prank. But I have no one who knows me well. Who would do this? Why? What is that beam? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to heed my dad’s advice. I ran downstairs, shutting all my windows and doors, and locked the metal door. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed down there for 5 years. I stretched my food rations as much as possible. I never wanted to leave. I hadn’t talked to anyone for 5 years, either. It made me crazy. It had been 8 days since I ate. I ran out of water the day before I did it. I didn’t want to go out. But I also didn’t want to starve. So, that’s why on April 6th, 2016, I opened that rusty old steel door. And what I saw confused me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing had changed. At least, not immediately. My house looked- clean. Cleaner than I imagined. Cleaner than I remembered. No dust or anything. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Am I dead? I thought. Is this purgatory or something? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking around when I saw something that made my blood curdle. It was my TV, still on. I was so confused. It was playing something about a Mississippi Governor signing a controversial religion law. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And the weirdest part about it? It wasn’t the channel I left it on. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking outside, and I almost passed out when I saw the grass. It was like little green spikes, all over the place. That’s not what grass looks like. Grass is circular, like flowers. They look like little disks. Not spikes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some other things were off as well. Tree bark looked tougher. It hurt to look directly at the sun. The clouds were whiter, rather than the yellowish ones I was used to. Everything seemed a bit off, and just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, I walked through the front door. No, not me. Someone else with my body. I stared at them. They didn’t see me at first. But they did eventually. We both froze. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran out of the house. I ran all the way down to the police station to see what was going on. I told them everything, and they asked me to calm down and to follow them into the back. I did, and they sat me down and told me to wait. An hour or so passed, and someone came in who looked like they worked for the government. They asked me tell them my story, so I did. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He then explained what happened. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On March 16th, 2011, a being above ours shot an energy beam at Earth. Almost everyone was obliterated. The remaining few people (who mostly were part of the government) decided to create genetic copies of everyone and put them in a simulation of our world. Everyone who died. The simulation wasn’t perfect, it had a few glitches, but it held up. This simulation of us surrounded our normal world, so we couldn’t tell the difference. It’s a hologram. Now of course, not everyone who survived the explosion liked this plan. Around 200,000 people, in fact. And the higher-ups killed them all. Their deaths were blamed by the Syrian Civil War inside the simulation. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man I was talking to said he was one of the survivors, simply being transported here temporarily to talk to me. He said that he would have my copy neutralized, and that if I didn’t tell anyone about this, I could pretend to be him and live out the rest of ‘my’ life. But it’s not my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And neither is yours. You’re a clone, a copy, of someone who died in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And you stole their life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The real world has curved grass. And yellow clouds. And the sun isn’t so bright. And the trees are smoother. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, the real world has the real you. The dead you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You’re an echo of yourself. You won’t believe this, I know that, but I want you to do something.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next time you’re looking for your phone and it’s suddenly in your hand, think. Was it really there a second ago? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If not, well, you’re just proving my point. You don’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing does.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Edit) Spelling&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My quarterback is out there getting his head ripped off, and I’m here hiding under the bleachers.\\n\\nI’m the worst coach ever. I’m not even a coach. I used to be. I used to tell the kids: “Win or lose, it’s the fight that counts.” And I believed it. And it was a good thing to believe, because we lost, year after year after year. The worst record in the division, for five years running, and before that, it was the second worst. RSU 51 got dissolved and we absorbed some of those kids and then we were the worst.\\n\\nIt wasn’t the kids’ fault, and it wasn’t my fault. We did our best with what we had. We just didn’t have much. Our practice field was lumpy and the grass never got mowed unless I did it myself. The equipment was old and nothing ever seemed to fit anybody. The kids all came from poor families and always had something pulling them away. We had the desire, and maybe even the raw talent… just not the means.\\n\\nI had a shit salary, and it felt shitty losing all the time, but I stuck with it, for the kids. I knew that if I left them, my replacement would by something that administration scraped up from the very bottom of the barrel. I at least knew how to play football, and knew, in theory, how to win. We just needed some money. That’s usually a bare requirement for winning.\\n\\nAt the start of the year, it looked like there was some hope. The school budget increased. But I didn’t let my hopes get too high. The whole school was in shambles. They were using textbooks from the 90’s in some classes, and I heard that they even reused the frogs that they dissected in biology class. At the end of the day, the teacher would stuff all of the organs back in, and then pack the dead frogs carefully in a freezer for the next year’s class.\\n\\nI met with Principal Jenkins in August. My heart was racing as I stepped in his office. I was hoping for good news, but expecting the usual shit news.\\n\\n“Milton,” said Jenkins. “You must have heard about the budget increase. Good news. It’s all going to the football team.”\\n\\nI couldn’t believe it. I pictured level playing fields and sparkling new helmets. Personalized jerseys, to instill some pride in the kids. “That *is* good news!” I said, smiling. I pushed back the thought of the kids reading history books that hadn’t caught up to 9/11 yet.\\n\\n“Take a look,” said Jenkins. He turned the laptop that was on his desk around so that I could see it. He reached over, and pushed play on a video that was queued up.\\n\\nOn the screen, I saw a big kid dressed in a hospital gown. He was completely bald, and was clutching a football. Three or four doctors (or I guessed they were doctors) stood on either side of him, each holding a clipboard. “Okay Duncan,” said one of them, “*run!*”\\n\\nThey appeared to be in an old horse barn. I watched as this Duncan kid took off, as soon as the doc had said the word. He was *fast*. He kept his head up and charged straight ahead. I felt giddy for a few moments until I saw that he was headed straight for the wooden gate to a horse stable. Then I winced, and started to turn away.\\n\\n“What is this?” I asked.\\n\\n“Just watch,” said Jenkins.\\n\\nI watched as the kid impacted with the gate. I expected him to bowl over backwards, but he didn’t. Instead, the gate splintered apart and he kept running. Now he was headed right for the back wall of the stable.\\n\\n“Jesus,” I said. “He’s gonna kill himself.”\\n\\nBut he didn’t. He ran *through* the wall, and came out the other side, still running like the dickens. Still running way faster than I ever did even in my prime.\\n\\n“*Touchdown*,” said one of the doctors. At that, the kid stopped in his tracks.\\n\\n“What is this?” I asked again.\\n\\n“That’s Duncan,” said Jenkins. “Your new running back. Milt…”\\n\\n“Yeah?”\\n\\n“Don’t fuck this up. Bring us back a championship.”\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nTo keep up appearances, we had to enroll Duncan in the high school.\\n\\nHe wasn’t much of a student. I watched him one day, from the hall. Steve Crawford, the English teacher, was actually crouched by his side, moving his hand across a piece of paper so that he could write his name. He stared listlessly ahead, at nothing.\\n\\nLater, I met up with Steve in the teacher’s lounge. “Just fucking win it, okay, Milt?” he said. “Just get this goddamn school on the map. I figure if we’ve got a good football team, that might bring other things along with it down the line. Like an annotated edition of *Moby Dick* that isn’t held together by duct tape.”\\n\\n“Sure, Steve. Thanks.”\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nOn the field, Duncan was a beast. The uneven ground didn’t bother him. Nothing did. You just had to give him the football, tell him to run, and that was it. The only way to stop him was to inform him of the touchdown. Nothing else could stop him. Not five guys hanging off him while three others launched themselves at his front side.\\n\\nI wouldn’t have gone along with it if it didn’t make the kids so happy. That’s not an excuse. I’m just explaining it. We all wanted this. We had been losing for so long that just the hint of a win made us delirious. Still, it was on me and me alone to stop it. And I didn’t.\\n\\nThe night of our first game, against the Lions, I skipped my usual pep talk of “Win or lose….” Instead, I gathered everybody together and said simply, “Get out there tonight and get Duncan the ball. We’re gonna kill ‘em.”\\n\\nEverybody cheered. And kill ‘em we did. Our defense was still shit (Duncan just stood there the whole time, not moving), but every time we got the ball, we scored. It was a slaughter, at 70-21.\\n\\nWith practice, we did get Duncan to play some D. It was really no use talking to him. When you said something, it was like he didn’t even hear. Finally, Nick Hanson, who was a damn fine linebacker, came up with an idea.\\n\\n“My little brother,” said Nick. “He’s, uh, a little slow. And what we do for him is take stuffed animals and put on a puppet show. That’s how we got him to put his dishes in the sink finally.”\\n\\nWe decided to give it a try with Duncan. “Okay buddy,” I said, “you’re this tiger here, okay? And this lamb with the ball… your job is to jump on him and bring him down. Okay? Watch.”\\n\\nWhen Duncan watched something, it was unnerving. His eyes didn’t blink. There wasn’t any expression whatsoever on his face. There *never* was. And his face… it seemed just a little too… *grey*.\\n\\nI did a little show with the stuffed animals. “Do you get it?” I asked.\\n\\nDuncan grunted. That was the most we ever got out of him. I thought that maybe meant he understood, but later on the field, it was clear that he didn’t. He just stood there, as usual, while our second string running back, Sammy Parker, ran circles around him.\\n\\nWe kept this up for weeks until one day, Duncan stuck out his arm and clotheslined Sammy. Sammy dropped like he’d just been shot in the head with a .44 Magnum. I ran over to check on him, while the kids all circled around Duncan and congratulated him.\\n\\nAfter a full minute, Sammy sat up and looked around, dazed. “What the fuck just happened?” he asked.\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nWe’ve been 5-0 this season. Usually we are 0-5.\\n\\nThere have been warning signs. Duncan has put four kids in the hospital so far. Hell, Duncan himself *was* the warning sign. The way he just stared, like his head was completely empty… and the way he ran, like he would have no problem killing anything in his path.\\n\\nTonight was our big game against the Eagles. The kids hated the Eagles, and so did I. They were from a district a couple dozen miles away where the houses had two-car garages and the parents weren’t all alcoholics. Or if they were, they were the rich kind that can get away with it.\\n\\nThey’d beaten us every year for the past 20 years, and that one win 21 years ago was just because their whole team came down with the flu.\\n\\n“Okay boys,” I said, in the locker room before the game. “I want you all to stay focused out there, and find a way to get the ball to Duncan.”\\n\\nWe huddled together, put our hands in, and chanted the rally: “Let’s go Crabs!” (That was our team name: the Crabs.)\\n\\nOn the field, it started off so well. The bleachers were packed, and everyone was fired up. It felt good.\\n\\nIn the first quarter, Duncan scored three touchdowns, and put the Eagles wide receiver out with a leg injury. I always hate to see kids injured like that… but I’m not going to lie here. It felt good, in this case.\\n\\nIt was the second quarter when the trouble started. Our boys were lined up for the snap when one of the Eagles stoop up and shouted. “Hey Duncan! I fucked your mom last night!”\\n\\nThe snap never came. Duncan charged across the scrimmage line and grabbed the kid’s facemask in one hand while he held his other hand against the kid’s chest. Then, in one quick motion, Duncan pulled the kid’s head away from his body. He held the severed head in his hand as the body dropped, and a ref blew his whistle.\\n\\nAt the sound of the whistle, Duncan turned and hurled the helmeted head at the offending ref. It must have impacted that ref’s own head at 150mph, minimum. He dropped to the ground, almost certainly dead.\\n\\nThe bleachers erupted, and I heard a gunshot. I looked over to see a man stepping down onto the field, holding a gun aimed straight at Duncan.\\n\\n“Hold on now!” I shouted, but it was no good. The field was in chaos.\\n\\nThe man walked a few more steps towards Duncan and then stopped. I heard him: “You son of a bitch.” Then he fired a round direct into Duncan’s chest. Everything got very quiet.\\n\\nDuncan didn’t drop. I saw the bullet hole in his chest, but he didn’t drop. Instead, he turned slowly to the man who had fired the shot. Then he took off his helmet and threw it to the ground. He started running at full Duncan speed toward the man.\\n\\n“Please stop!” I shouted. My mind was a wreck. I didn’t know what to do, or even what was happening.\\n\\nAnother gunshot rang out, and I saw the bullet hole in the center of Duncan’s head. He didn’t slow down. He ran up to the man, reached into his chest, and pulled his heart out.\\n\\n“Duncan!” I tried. “Touchdown! Touchdown!” It didn’t work. Something had been set off in him. He turned and started grabbing people, tearing them apart. A mess of blood and body parts flew through the air like hail Marys under the electric lights of the field.\\n\\nI ran out on the field towards Duncan. I was frightened, but I had to try to do something. Maybe he would listen to me. I *was* his coach after all.\\n\\n“Duncan,” I said. “Please listen to me.”\\n\\nHe lifted me up and threw me 20 feet through the air.\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nWhen I regained consciousness, I was under the bleachers, looking at a hundred dead bodies strewn across the field.\\n\\nThe police are here now, but they’re not doing much good. Duncan is riddled with hundreds of bullet holes, but is still out there killing people.\\n\\nI don’t think any of us are going to get out of this alive. So I wanted to tell you how it happened, before I go out there and try to stop him again. I know I’ll die, but I have to try. I’m responsible for this. I don’t know who or really what Duncan is, but I know that I never should have let him on the team. I’ve always known that.\\n\\nThe things we do to win. Only now does it come back to me. That’s not what counts. It’s the fight that counts.\\n\\nI am so sorry. Goodbye.',\n",

I watched as this Duncan kid took off, as soon as the doc had said the word. He was &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. He kept his head up and charged straight ahead. I felt giddy for a few moments until I saw that he was headed straight for the wooden gate to a horse stable. Then I winced, and started to turn away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What is this?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just watch,” said Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched as the kid impacted with the gate. I expected him to bowl over backwards, but he didn’t. Instead, the gate splintered apart and he kept running. Now he was headed right for the back wall of the stable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus,” I said. “He’s gonna kill himself.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn’t. He ran &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the wall, and came out the other side, still running like the dickens. Still running way faster than I ever did even in my prime.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Touchdown&lt;/em&gt;,” said one of the doctors. At that, the kid stopped in his tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What is this?” I asked again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s Duncan,” said Jenkins. “Your new running back. Milt…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t fuck this up. Bring us back a championship.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To keep up appearances, we had to enroll Duncan in the high school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t much of a student. I watched him one day, from the hall. Steve Crawford, the English teacher, was actually crouched by his side, moving his hand across a piece of paper so that he could write his name. He stared listlessly ahead, at nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I met up with Steve in the teacher’s lounge. “Just fucking win it, okay, Milt?” he said. “Just get this goddamn school on the map. I figure if we’ve got a good football team, that might bring other things along with it down the line. Like an annotated edition of &lt;em&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/em&gt; that isn’t held together by duct tape.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Steve. Thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the field, Duncan was a beast. The uneven ground didn’t bother him. Nothing did. You just had to give him the football, tell him to run, and that was it. The only way to stop him was to inform him of the touchdown. Nothing else could stop him. Not five guys hanging off him while three others launched themselves at his front side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have gone along with it if it didn’t make the kids so happy. That’s not an excuse. I’m just explaining it. We all wanted this. We had been losing for so long that just the hint of a win made us delirious. Still, it was on me and me alone to stop it. And I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The night of our first game, against the Lions, I skipped my usual pep talk of “Win or lose….” Instead, I gathered everybody together and said simply, “Get out there tonight and get Duncan the ball. We’re gonna kill ‘em.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everybody cheered. And kill ‘em we did. Our defense was still shit (Duncan just stood there the whole time, not moving), but every time we got the ball, we scored. It was a slaughter, at 70-21.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With practice, we did get Duncan to play some D. It was really no use talking to him. When you said something, it was like he didn’t even hear. Finally, Nick Hanson, who was a damn fine linebacker, came up with an idea.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My little brother,” said Nick. “He’s, uh, a little slow. And what we do for him is take stuffed animals and put on a puppet show. That’s how we got him to put his dishes in the sink finally.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to give it a try with Duncan. “Okay buddy,” I said, “you’re this tiger here, okay? And this lamb with the ball… your job is to jump on him and bring him down. Okay? Watch.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When Duncan watched something, it was unnerving. His eyes didn’t blink. There wasn’t any expression whatsoever on his face. There &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; was. And his face… it seemed just a little too… &lt;em&gt;grey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did a little show with the stuffed animals. “Do you get it?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Duncan grunted. That was the most we ever got out of him. I thought that maybe meant he understood, but later on the field, it was clear that he didn’t. He just stood there, as usual, while our second string running back, Sammy Parker, ran circles around him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We kept this up for weeks until one day, Duncan stuck out his arm and clotheslined Sammy. Sammy dropped like he’d just been shot in the head with a .44 Magnum. I ran over to check on him, while the kids all circled around Duncan and congratulated him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a full minute, Sammy sat up and looked around, dazed. “What the fuck just happened?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We’ve been 5-0 this season. Usually we are 0-5.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There have been warning signs. Duncan has put four kids in the hospital so far. Hell, Duncan himself &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the warning sign. The way he just stared, like his head was completely empty… and the way he ran, like he would have no problem killing anything in his path.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight was our big game against the Eagles. The kids hated the Eagles, and so did I. They were from a district a couple dozen miles away where the houses had two-car garages and the parents weren’t all alcoholics. Or if they were, they were the rich kind that can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They’d beaten us every year for the past 20 years, and that one win 21 years ago was just because their whole team came down with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay boys,” I said, in the locker room before the game. “I want you all to stay focused out there, and find a way to get the ball to Duncan.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We huddled together, put our hands in, and chanted the rally: “Let’s go Crabs!” (That was our team name: the Crabs.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the field, it started off so well. The bleachers were packed, and everyone was fired up. It felt good.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, Duncan scored three touchdowns, and put the Eagles wide receiver out with a leg injury. I always hate to see kids injured like that… but I’m not going to lie here. It felt good, in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was the second quarter when the trouble started. Our boys were lined up for the snap when one of the Eagles stoop up and shouted. “Hey Duncan! I fucked your mom last night!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The snap never came. Duncan charged across the scrimmage line and grabbed the kid’s facemask in one hand while he held his other hand against the kid’s chest. Then, in one quick motion, Duncan pulled the kid’s head away from his body. He held the severed head in his hand as the body dropped, and a ref blew his whistle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At the sound of the whistle, Duncan turned and hurled the helmeted head at the offending ref. It must have impacted that ref’s own head at 150mph, minimum. He dropped to the ground, almost certainly dead.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bleachers erupted, and I heard a gunshot. I looked over to see a man stepping down onto the field, holding a gun aimed straight at Duncan.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hold on now!” I shouted, but it was no good. The field was in chaos.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man walked a few more steps towards Duncan and then stopped. I heard him: “You son of a bitch.” Then he fired a round direct into Duncan’s chest. Everything got very quiet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Duncan didn’t drop. I saw the bullet hole in his chest, but he didn’t drop. Instead, he turned slowly to the man who had fired the shot. Then he took off his helmet and threw it to the ground. He started running at full Duncan speed toward the man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Please stop!” I shouted. My mind was a wreck. I didn’t know what to do, or even what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another gunshot rang out, and I saw the bullet hole in the center of Duncan’s head. He didn’t slow down. He ran up to the man, reached into his chest, and pulled his heart out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Duncan!” I tried. “Touchdown! Touchdown!” It didn’t work. Something had been set off in him. He turned and started grabbing people, tearing them apart. A mess of blood and body parts flew through the air like hail Marys under the electric lights of the field.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran out on the field towards Duncan. I was frightened, but I had to try to do something. Maybe he would listen to me. I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; his coach after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Duncan,” I said. “Please listen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He lifted me up and threw me 20 feet through the air.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I regained consciousness, I was under the bleachers, looking at a hundred dead bodies strewn across the field.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The police are here now, but they’re not doing much good. Duncan is riddled with hundreds of bullet holes, but is still out there killing people.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any of us are going to get out of this alive. So I wanted to tell you how it happened, before I go out there and try to stop him again. I know I’ll die, but I have to try. I’m responsible for this. I don’t know who or really what Duncan is, but I know that I never should have let him on the team. I’ve always known that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The things we do to win. Only now does it come back to me. That’s not what counts. It’s the fight that counts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry. Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\\n\\nI live in a small town in Oregon. There are maybe 500 people that live here, and most have been here their whole lives. I moved out here about 3 years ago to take care of my grandfather. He passed not long after, and I inherited his home. It\\'s not anything special, but why not take a free home? I\\'ve since picked up a logging job and decided to stay out here. It\\'s normally very peaceful.\\n\\nIt was 5 o\\'clock last night when everything started. I\\'ve been awake for so long now. The clock in my room say it\\'s 4AM. It all started after dinner. I work early, usually 5 AM to 1 PM, so I eat an early dinner when I get home. I was cooking some broccoli and potatoes, nothing special. I know they\\'d been calling for storms for a few days, but it was getting too dark out. It wasn\\'t the normal grey and gloomy. It was an inky black sky that no light could pierce. There was no lightning, but it was windy. VERY windy.\\n\\nI had the TV on, just random Hulu shows playing in the background while I cooked, when it cut to something different. It cut to an \"Emergency Alert\" screen in all red. It painted the room in bright red light. I\\'d never seen something like it before, it wasn\\'t a normal \"alert\" you would get during a bad storm. It stayed on the screen for about a minute, then it started flashing. \"You are required to shut your doors, windows and vents. Turn off your lights. Stay out of hallways and basements. Choose a room on the second floor if able and lock your door. Do not come out until advised.\"\\n\\nAs soon as it started flashing on the screen, I heard it in town. I think they were using the tornado siren as a giant megaphone, because the quality was awful, but I could tell what it was saying. I figured it was just a worse storm than the meteorologists were assuming so they were taking extra precautions. I went to finish cooking my dinner when I heard a crack at the front door. It sounded like a branch may have hit it, hard. It\\'s happened before so I paid it no mind.\\n\\nI got the food and headed into the living room where the alert was still playing. It kept flashing and then, the TV went out. Not the power, just the TV. I shrugged it off and decided that maybe it was a bad storm, so I took my laptop and went to my room. It\\'s on the first floor and is in the middle of the house, so I figured it was safer than any room with windows. As I walked down the hall, passed the bathroom and a few windows, I noticed now that it was almost pitch-black outside. I could barely make out trees that were 10 feet away from the house.\\n\\nI made it to the room, shut the door, and locked it. I took two steps away, and something jiggled the handle. It wasn\\'t just a slight jiggle. It was a few, direct tries at opening the door. \"What the fuck, hello?\" I asked. I looked under the door and saw a shadow against the hallway light. It moved away, and the hallway light turned off. I went to grab my phone and call 911, not taking any chances. No signal. Great. Checked my laptop, still had internet. I decided maybe it was just the storm knocking out a few fuses. No big deal. I started to eat my meal and turned on my room TV, only to see the same exact message. \"You are required to shut your doors, windows and vents. Turn off your lights. Stay out of hallways and basements. Choose a room on the second floor if able and lock your door. Do not come out until advised.\" I tried changing channels, using different apps, but still the same. I didn\\'t know they could take control of entire smart tv\\'s but okay.\\n\\nI finished my dinner and hopped on the computer. I started to browse twitter when I heard another noise. It was my front door opening, then closing. I heard footsteps throughout the house. It came closer with every step, until it was right at my door. Again, something tried my doorknob. Freaked out, I crept over to the wall and turned off my light. Checked my phone, still no signal. I went back over to the other side of the room and heard something else. My windows. It sounded as though every single window in my house had been opened at the same time. I KNOW that I keep them locked, I practically check them every day. I heard footsteps from, at least 10 people. They were walking all throughout my house. Looters? It wasn\\'t even raining, it\\'s not like it was an insane storm. I heard the wind still but nothing else, no rain, no thunder, just the wind and the \"siren\" phrase in town.\\xa0\\n\\nI started to hyperventilate and decided to hide in my closet. The other side of the closet is the hallway, so I could hear every step. They were pacing. It seemed like they were pacing in a row, each getting a turn to try my doorknob. This went on for at least an hour, then it just stopped. The wind stopped, the pacing stopped, and the alert went away. The hallway light is back on. The only thing is, the siren is still running in town. It\\'s repeating the same exact message.\\xa0\\n\\nI\\'m too afraid to open the door and look. Why would the alerts go away except the one in town? Something still doesn\\'t feel right. I\\'m going to go back into the closet and try to sleep. If I keep the door locked, I should be fine... right?',\n",

I heard the wind still but nothing else, no rain, no thunder, just the wind and the &amp;quot;siren&amp;quot; phrase in town.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I started to hyperventilate and decided to hide in my closet. The other side of the closet is the hallway, so I could hear every step. They were pacing. It seemed like they were pacing in a row, each getting a turn to try my doorknob. This went on for at least an hour, then it just stopped. The wind stopped, the pacing stopped, and the alert went away. The hallway light is back on. The only thing is, the siren is still running in town. It&amp;#39;s repeating the same exact message.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m too afraid to open the door and look. Why would the alerts go away except the one in town? Something still doesn&amp;#39;t feel right. I&amp;#39;m going to go back into the closet and try to sleep. If I keep the door locked, I should be fine... right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '*Shes cheating on you, you know.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy wife was looking at me with the eyes that I fell in love with, bright blue with a tear running down her left cheek from spending the last five minutes laughing too hard. She wiped a tear away and playfully slapped me on the chest as I pulled her in an ran my fingers through her sides, causing her to burst out in laughter again. It was in this joyous, casual moment that I first heard the voice.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI looked around for the accuser, and saw nothing. With a deep breath I passed it off, and sat down on the couch, beckoning for Eliza to do the same. She walked over with a suspect look on her face, and I promised that I wouldn\\'t tickle her any more tonight. Once she sat, I wrapped her up in my arms and flipped on a movie that we would inevitably fall asleep to.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Isn\\'t it strange? You almost never have nights like these anymore... but every once in awhile...*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Did you hear that?\" I asked, shooting up from my relaxed position. It sounded so clear, like whoever was talking was right behind us.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Hear what, sweetie?\" Her face was as perplexed as mine, but clearly for a different reason. I wiped a bead of sweat off my forehead, and took one more look around the living room and kitchen area to no avail.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m not feeling too well and I think I\\'m just going to call it a night. I\\'m sorry, rain check for a movie tomorrow night?\" I replied, leaning down over the couch to give her a kiss on the forehead.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Oh, okay..\" She replied, her tone suggesting that she was disappointed. I did feel bad, but I just needed some sleep. When she got up to follow me to bed, I told Eliza that she should stay up and get some of her work done, and that me going to bed early shouldn\\'t mean she has to as well. With a nod of agreement, we parted ways for the evening.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I got to the bedroom, I shed my daytime clothes and crawled in to our king size mattress. The longer I laid down, the more I thought to myself that I had overreacted. Surely I had been imagining things and there was no reason for me to be as freaked out as I was. After about an hour, I was about to get up to rejoin my wife in the living room when I felt a pressure in the crook of my neck, right where Eliza would lie her head at night when we would cuddle up before falling asleep. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I felt the phantom pressure stroking my chest now, just as Eliza would.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Shh, I mean you no harm. I just want to show you the love you deserve.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe voice was smooth like honey, if it weren\\'t for the extreme circumstances I would have found it relaxing, perhaps a voice that would fit well in a meditation video. My eyes went wide, and I tried my hardest to struggle, but my body wouldn\\'t cooperate. It felt as though a thousand ton weight were sitting on each of my limbs, making it impossible to move.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, as a child, I was obsessed with everything paranormal, and I spent years of my adolescence trying to contact one spirit or another. I tried summoning circles, the elevator game, ouija boards, you name it. Nothing was ever successful of course, but it was oh so entertaining. As an adult, I had put away those childish adventures and stored them, as well as all of the knowledge of other-worldly beings, in a far recess of my brain. Therefore, despite knowing exactly what this being was, and how to combat it, I would never be able to recall that information in time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"What do you want from me,\" I thought inwardly, hoping that whatever was subduing me was able to hear my thoughts.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I just told you my dear, I want to show you the love that you deserve. I want to show you that, that* ***bitch*** *that you call a wife has been lying to you for years.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you dare speak about Eliza that way!\" I shouted with as much animosity as my internal voice could muster.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I can prove it. I\\'m going to let you go, ask her about Marcus. I will be here for you afterwards.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs soon as the voice finished its sentence, all of the weight was removed from my body, and I jerked upwards. I got out of bed and flipped back on the light. I swear I saw a flash of blonde hair in the mirror on the door at the moment the light spilled throughout the room, but when I turned around, nothing was there.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI peered into the mirror contemplating what to do. It could be crazy of me to actually believe.. whatever it was that was just speaking to me right? I\\'ve been with Eliza for fourteen years and we have been nothing but happy the entire time. I mean sure, we had our spats, but every couple does. It\\'s healthy to have arguments from time to time. Also we spent most of our time together, surely I would notice if she had been gone long enough to actually cheat? Then again it couldn\\'t hurt to ask. I didn\\'t have to phrase it as an accusatory statement, if the name Marcus rang a bell then I would be able to tell by her reaction, Eliza is terrible at hiding her emotions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nJust as I made a decision, the door opened and Eliza came into the bedroom, already half naked. She met my eyes and gave me a devilish smile before crawling on to the bed, looking back at me like she wanted to play. I sat down next to her, not in the mood.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"This is going to sound crazy, but I need to ask you something.\" My eyes didn\\'t meet hers as I spoke, and she immediately realized that gravity of my mood.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Is this about what happened earlier?\" Eliza ran her fingers down my arm as she moved closer. I shrugged them off.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Tell me about Marcus.\" I said, looking up to meet her gaze for the first time in what felt like eternity.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt only took a moment to realize that whatever entity spoke to me earlier was telling the truth. Eliza\\'s face became pained and her voice began to stutter as she looked for an explanation. I needed none.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I told you. Come, be with me.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI spent the next week in a motel. To say I was depressed would be an understatement. I had the paperwork for divorce filled out and sitting on the scratched wooden dresser in front of me, crying as I signed the final few forms.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I\\'ll make you breakfast tomorrow morning. We can be beautiful together.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Who are you!\" I shouted. The voice hadn\\'t left me alone since the first time I heard it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I\\'ve been in love with you for as long as I can remember. You can\\'t see me, but I\\'ve always been here. I know this is strange, that\\'s why I waited to long to make contact, but I couldn\\'t stand to see things go the way they were anymore.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs the being spoke, I received another text from Eliza, trying to apologize and explain more. I threw my phone at the wall and it shattered into a million pieces. A manic giggle escaped my lips as I imagined the Android as my heart. How poetic, I thought.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"How can you love me, I have no idea who you are. I have no idea **what** you are.\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I know this is hard to comprehend..*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI felt the phantom touch on the small of my back once more and I spun around throwing my hands wildly around. I couldn\\'t take it any more. Was I crazy?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Stop touching me!\" I screamed, throwing a fist down onto the dresser. Pain shot through my hand, I had probably broken at least a pinky finger.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*You have my word, I won\\'t touch you again until you are ready. I\\'ll be around later. I must collect the things to make you breakfast for the morning. I know you don\\'t want to hear this, but I do love you.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI let out a grunt and put my head down on the desk. Why was this happening? I\\'m a good person, I work hard, I\\'ve always been honest and faithful, I don\\'t deserve this bullshit.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe next morning there were scrambled eggs and Canadian bacon drizzled with maple syrup on the counter, still steaming when I woke up. That was my favorite meal, how did it get here?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Good morning, would it be okay for me to speak?*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Did.. did you make this?\" I asked, slowly making my way over to the delicious smelling feast.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I did. I know it\\'s your favorite.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"How?\" I inspected each piece of bacon, making sure it wasn\\'t some trick that my broken mind was playing on me, but it felt real. it smelled real, and it certainly tasted real. In fact, as I took the first bite I thought that it might have been the best cooked breakfast I had ever had. I also reflected on the fact that it might have been crazy for me to so willingly trust this food that appeared in such a.. strange.. method, but at this point I hardly cared.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I told you, I\\'ve loved you for a long time. I know everything about you.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Normally, I would tell you how incredibly creepy that is, but honestly, this food is so good I\\'m willing to let it slide.\" I finished every last bite in no time, it must have been days since I had any decent food.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Would it be okay if I touched you again?*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"I.. I guess that would be okay.\" As soon as I responded I felt the familiar pressure of hands being wrapped around my waist and a body being pressed up against my back. I turned my head around, but nothing was there. Not that I expected anything different.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"Why can\\'t I see you?\" I asked, feeling the desire now to know who or what it was that was providing me with these small comforts.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*I think you know why. I do not exist in the same plane as you, and while I can interact with it to a small degree, showing myself in a visible form would be to much for my spirit to take, and I would pass on to the next world. If you would like however, I can visit you in your dreams.*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\"I think I would like that.\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTwo years have passed since then. I\\'ve since learned that my new friend\\'s name is Lea\\'Sah, and that she really does have my best interests in mind. She stays with me all the time, and although I have tried to date a few different \\'real\\' girls, none of them seem to have the connection that we do. Every night, Lea visits me in my dreams, and every night she looks different. Some days she appears as a supermodel-esque tall brunette with long legs and a curvy body, and other nights as a petite blonde with glasses and messy clothes. It seems that she knows exactly what I want, always.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe now share a one bedroom condo off on the countryside. Breakfast is served every morning, always piping hot and precisely what my morning brain is fiending for. I\\'ve asked Lea if she is able to enjoy that same food that I am, and she promises that on her side she is eating the same thing. It feels strange, but somehow I feel happier now then I have ever before, and although I know that I\\'ll never be able to truly see her, I know in my heart of hearts.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShe is the most [beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPWrites/) girl I\\'ve never seen.',\n",

Therefore, despite knowing exactly what this being was, and how to combat it, I would never be able to recall that information in time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want from me,&amp;quot; I thought inwardly, hoping that whatever was subduing me was able to hear my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just told you my dear, I want to show you the love that you deserve. I want to show you that, that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;that you call a wife has been lying to you for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you dare speak about Eliza that way!&amp;quot; I shouted with as much animosity as my internal voice could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can prove it. I&amp;#39;m going to let you go, ask her about Marcus. I will be here for you afterwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as the voice finished its sentence, all of the weight was removed from my body, and I jerked upwards. I got out of bed and flipped back on the light. I swear I saw a flash of blonde hair in the mirror on the door at the moment the light spilled throughout the room, but when I turned around, nothing was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I peered into the mirror contemplating what to do. It could be crazy of me to actually believe.. whatever it was that was just speaking to me right? I&amp;#39;ve been with Eliza for fourteen years and we have been nothing but happy the entire time. I mean sure, we had our spats, but every couple does. It&amp;#39;s healthy to have arguments from time to time. Also we spent most of our time together, surely I would notice if she had been gone long enough to actually cheat? Then again it couldn&amp;#39;t hurt to ask. I didn&amp;#39;t have to phrase it as an accusatory statement, if the name Marcus rang a bell then I would be able to tell by her reaction, Eliza is terrible at hiding her emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just as I made a decision, the door opened and Eliza came into the bedroom, already half naked. She met my eyes and gave me a devilish smile before crawling on to the bed, looking back at me like she wanted to play. I sat down next to her, not in the mood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is going to sound crazy, but I need to ask you something.&amp;quot; My eyes didn&amp;#39;t meet hers as I spoke, and she immediately realized that gravity of my mood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this about what happened earlier?&amp;quot; Eliza ran her fingers down my arm as she moved closer. I shrugged them off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me about Marcus.&amp;quot; I said, looking up to meet her gaze for the first time in what felt like eternity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It only took a moment to realize that whatever entity spoke to me earlier was telling the truth. Eliza&amp;#39;s face became pained and her voice began to stutter as she looked for an explanation. I needed none.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I told you. Come, be with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the next week in a motel. To say I was depressed would be an understatement. I had the paperwork for divorce filled out and sitting on the scratched wooden dresser in front of me, crying as I signed the final few forms.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make you breakfast tomorrow morning. We can be beautiful together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you!&amp;quot; I shouted. The voice hadn&amp;#39;t left me alone since the first time I heard it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in love with you for as long as I can remember. You can&amp;#39;t see me, but I&amp;#39;ve always been here. I know this is strange, that&amp;#39;s why I waited to long to make contact, but I couldn&amp;#39;t stand to see things go the way they were anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the being spoke, I received another text from Eliza, trying to apologize and explain more. I threw my phone at the wall and it shattered into a million pieces. A manic giggle escaped my lips as I imagined the Android as my heart. How poetic, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How can you love me, I have no idea who you are. I have no idea &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; you are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know this is hard to comprehend..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I felt the phantom touch on the small of my back once more and I spun around throwing my hands wildly around. I couldn&amp;#39;t take it any more. Was I crazy?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop touching me!&amp;quot; I screamed, throwing a fist down onto the dresser. Pain shot through my hand, I had probably broken at least a pinky finger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have my word, I won&amp;#39;t touch you again until you are ready. I&amp;#39;ll be around later. I must collect the things to make you breakfast for the morning. I know you don&amp;#39;t want to hear this, but I do love you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I let out a grunt and put my head down on the desk. Why was this happening? I&amp;#39;m a good person, I work hard, I&amp;#39;ve always been honest and faithful, I don&amp;#39;t deserve this bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning there were scrambled eggs and Canadian bacon drizzled with maple syrup on the counter, still steaming when I woke up. That was my favorite meal, how did it get here?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good morning, would it be okay for me to speak?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did.. did you make this?&amp;quot; I asked, slowly making my way over to the delicious smelling feast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did. I know it&amp;#39;s your favorite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How?&amp;quot; I inspected each piece of bacon, making sure it wasn&amp;#39;t some trick that my broken mind was playing on me, but it felt real. it smelled real, and it certainly tasted real. In fact, as I took the first bite I thought that it might have been the best cooked breakfast I had ever had. I also reflected on the fact that it might have been crazy for me to so willingly trust this food that appeared in such a.. strange.. method, but at this point I hardly cared.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I told you, I&amp;#39;ve loved you for a long time. I know everything about you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Normally, I would tell you how incredibly creepy that is, but honestly, this food is so good I&amp;#39;m willing to let it slide.&amp;quot; I finished every last bite in no time, it must have been days since I had any decent food.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would it be okay if I touched you again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I.. I guess that would be okay.&amp;quot; As soon as I responded I felt the familiar pressure of hands being wrapped around my waist and a body being pressed up against my back. I turned my head around, but nothing was there. Not that I expected anything different.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t I see you?&amp;quot; I asked, feeling the desire now to know who or what it was that was providing me with these small comforts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think you know why. I do not exist in the same plane as you, and while I can interact with it to a small degree, showing myself in a visible form would be to much for my spirit to take, and I would pass on to the next world. If you would like however, I can visit you in your dreams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think I would like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two years have passed since then. I&amp;#39;ve since learned that my new friend&amp;#39;s name is Lea&amp;#39;Sah, and that she really does have my best interests in mind. She stays with me all the time, and although I have tried to date a few different &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; girls, none of them seem to have the connection that we do. Every night, Lea visits me in my dreams, and every night she looks different. Some days she appears as a supermodel-esque tall brunette with long legs and a curvy body, and other nights as a petite blonde with glasses and messy clothes. It seems that she knows exactly what I want, always.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We now share a one bedroom condo off on the countryside. Breakfast is served every morning, always piping hot and precisely what my morning brain is fiending for. I&amp;#39;ve asked Lea if she is able to enjoy that same food that I am, and she promises that on her side she is eating the same thing. It feels strange, but somehow I feel happier now then I have ever before, and although I know that I&amp;#39;ll never be able to truly see her, I know in my heart of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She is the most &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BPWrites/\"&gt;beautiful&lt;/a&gt; girl I&amp;#39;ve never seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Mr. Johnson always greeted me with a smile in the morning. He’d flaunt those pearly whites shamelessly, just barely noticeable under that crazy moustache (you know the one where it sort of looks like a crow has died trying to consume your nose), and he’d wave energetically as I walked down to my mailbox. I’d raise my hand idly and do the old “good morning neighbor”-routine, but I’d quickly retreat to avoid getting trapped in conversation. He was nice enough, but he was one of those extremely neat and extremely boring kind of people. If he caught you off guard you’d be talking about the weather for hours.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMr. Johnson moved in next door a little over a month ago. The place had been empty for a year or so, ever since old man Gordon kicked the bucket. He didn’t have many relatives, and it took them awhile to figure out who’d be taking over the property. After six months the deed was signed over to his nephew, who in turn tried to flip the place post-haste. But because of the nature of his uncle’s death (he was found rotting in his basement a month after he died), there wasn’t much interest. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUntil Mr. Johnson came around.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe didn’t seem to mind the history of the place at all. In fact, he’d brag about it constantly, as if the rot-stain on the concrete floor was some sort of trophy. It didn’t bother me at first; I like a good cadaver-story just as much as the next guy, but when you factored in the moustache and that holier-than-thou smirk, it became increasingly tiresome. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd then I started noticing that he always seemed to have blood on his clothes.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don’t know when it started, but I know that after I first noticed it I couldn’t *not* see it anymore. It was just so obvious, yet so indistinguishable. Everyday; clean clothes, fresh blood stain. On his sleeve, on the leg of his pants, on the collar of his shirt, on the tip of his boots. Just a little drop, a vague smudge of red, a little hint of the old crimson. And his smile was fading. Just a tad bleaker every morning. A little broodier, a little darker. Until it was gone. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI’d ask him about the blood sometimes. Just, you know, out of curiosity. You can’t help it when you keep seeing it daily. You need answers. It’s human nature.\\n\\n“So,” I’d say, “What’s with the blood?”\\n\\n“It’s just paint,” he’d say, avoiding eye-contact at all cost, “I’ve been redoing the basement.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd so it went. Every other day I’d ask again, and he would reply with some incompetent excuse that wouldn’t hold up in court. I believed him for a bit, I’ll admit it; he did seem like the type that would “redo” things just to have something to blab on about with his golf-buddies. But after the second week of “painting” my skepticism was skyrocketing. And with the accelerated decline of his smile, I knew something dubious was going on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo one day I decided enough was enough, and just confronted him right there on the street.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“So,” I said, “Wanna show me your basement?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe stared at me for quite some time, his moustache dancing like a drunk caterpillar, his eyebrows raising and lowering like pinball flippers. I could see a drop of sweat forming on his forehead, slowly making its way down to the root of his nose. His eyes darted back and forth like they were following a phantom laser pointer.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Sure,” he eventually responded, “But, um, I’m not done redoing it yet, it’s a bit messy.”\\n\\nI just shrugged. “I don’t mind,” I said, “I just want to see how it’s coming along.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe nodded nervously and awkwardly ushered me up his driveway. I paced up to his door, and turned to face him. He seemed flustered, no doubt about it. He definitely had something to hide.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“In we go, then,” he said weirdly as he opened the door.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI followed him in and looked around briefly as we walked towards the stairs leading to the basement. He’d really managed to fix the place up. Everything was sparkling new and shiny.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Very nice,” I noted, “You’ve been hard at work I see.”\\n\\nHe nodded and gave me a half-hearted smile. “Yes, but the basement is proving to be quite a handful.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI followed him down the stairs into the basement. At first glance everything seemed perfect.  Shiny hardwood floors covered the old concrete, the walls were painted in a tasteful crimson color, and he’d even replaced the old window with a stylishly profiled one. I raised my eyebrow inquisitively.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“This is spotless,” I said, “I thought you said it was messy?”\\n\\nHe hanged his head in what I assumed to be shame. “Yes, but there’s this thing,” he pointed to the corner of the room, “Behind the sofa.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe walked over to the sofa and motioned for me to take a look. I followed close behind and peered over his shoulder.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Ah, yes,” I said knowingly, “I see what you mean.”\\n\\n“It keeps coming back,” he complained, “I don’t know what to do. It must be rust or something.”\\n\\n“I have an idea,” I said staring into the back of his neck, “Forget all about it.”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe turned to face me, his expression quite bewildered. I jabbed my knife into his jugular with some precision, and enjoyed the brief shower of blood before he sank down to the ground, a lovely pool of crimson steadily growing around him. It didn’t take long before his heart gave up, and he just lay there motionless, his ridiculous moustache now slightly more tolerable tinted red.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n“Is that still paint on your clothes?” I said mockingly.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hung his body head down from the ceiling with a rope I found in his garage. The last remaining pints of blood dripped into the bucket below, the soothing clanks and glops like chicken soup for the soul. I studied the stain hidden behind his sofa. It would appear I had a leak; the brown-red mush gathering in a stinking pond looking all too familiar. I suspected one of the pipes of my acid tanks needed some fixing. It must have seeped into the foundations, eventually ending up here. Such a shame really; it completely ruined the new hardwood floors.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen night falls I’ll drag his body home and drop it into one of the tanks. It will take two days for the bones to dissolve. That should be enough time to fix the leak and clean up this mess.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI seriously hope the next owner doesn’t have a [moustache](https://www.reddit.com/user/hyperobscura/).',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Johnson always greeted me with a smile in the morning. He’d flaunt those pearly whites shamelessly, just barely noticeable under that crazy moustache (you know the one where it sort of looks like a crow has died trying to consume your nose), and he’d wave energetically as I walked down to my mailbox. I’d raise my hand idly and do the old “good morning neighbor”-routine, but I’d quickly retreat to avoid getting trapped in conversation. He was nice enough, but he was one of those extremely neat and extremely boring kind of people. If he caught you off guard you’d be talking about the weather for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Johnson moved in next door a little over a month ago. The place had been empty for a year or so, ever since old man Gordon kicked the bucket. He didn’t have many relatives, and it took them awhile to figure out who’d be taking over the property. After six months the deed was signed over to his nephew, who in turn tried to flip the place post-haste. But because of the nature of his uncle’s death (he was found rotting in his basement a month after he died), there wasn’t much interest. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Until Mr. Johnson came around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t seem to mind the history of the place at all. In fact, he’d brag about it constantly, as if the rot-stain on the concrete floor was some sort of trophy. It didn’t bother me at first; I like a good cadaver-story just as much as the next guy, but when you factored in the moustache and that holier-than-thou smirk, it became increasingly tiresome. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then I started noticing that he always seemed to have blood on his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know when it started, but I know that after I first noticed it I couldn’t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; see it anymore. It was just so obvious, yet so indistinguishable. Everyday; clean clothes, fresh blood stain. On his sleeve, on the leg of his pants, on the collar of his shirt, on the tip of his boots. Just a little drop, a vague smudge of red, a little hint of the old crimson. And his smile was fading. Just a tad bleaker every morning. A little broodier, a little darker. Until it was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’d ask him about the blood sometimes. Just, you know, out of curiosity. You can’t help it when you keep seeing it daily. You need answers. It’s human nature.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So,” I’d say, “What’s with the blood?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s just paint,” he’d say, avoiding eye-contact at all cost, “I’ve been redoing the basement.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And so it went. Every other day I’d ask again, and he would reply with some incompetent excuse that wouldn’t hold up in court. I believed him for a bit, I’ll admit it; he did seem like the type that would “redo” things just to have something to blab on about with his golf-buddies. But after the second week of “painting” my skepticism was skyrocketing. And with the accelerated decline of his smile, I knew something dubious was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So one day I decided enough was enough, and just confronted him right there on the street.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So,” I said, “Wanna show me your basement?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stared at me for quite some time, his moustache dancing like a drunk caterpillar, his eyebrows raising and lowering like pinball flippers. I could see a drop of sweat forming on his forehead, slowly making its way down to the root of his nose. His eyes darted back and forth like they were following a phantom laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure,” he eventually responded, “But, um, I’m not done redoing it yet, it’s a bit messy.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just shrugged. “I don’t mind,” I said, “I just want to see how it’s coming along.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded nervously and awkwardly ushered me up his driveway. I paced up to his door, and turned to face him. He seemed flustered, no doubt about it. He definitely had something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“In we go, then,” he said weirdly as he opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I followed him in and looked around briefly as we walked towards the stairs leading to the basement. He’d really managed to fix the place up. Everything was sparkling new and shiny.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Very nice,” I noted, “You’ve been hard at work I see.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded and gave me a half-hearted smile. “Yes, but the basement is proving to be quite a handful.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I followed him down the stairs into the basement. At first glance everything seemed perfect.  Shiny hardwood floors covered the old concrete, the walls were painted in a tasteful crimson color, and he’d even replaced the old window with a stylishly profiled one. I raised my eyebrow inquisitively.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This is spotless,” I said, “I thought you said it was messy?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He hanged his head in what I assumed to be shame. “Yes, but there’s this thing,” he pointed to the corner of the room, “Behind the sofa.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He walked over to the sofa and motioned for me to take a look. I followed close behind and peered over his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah, yes,” I said knowingly, “I see what you mean.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It keeps coming back,” he complained, “I don’t know what to do. It must be rust or something.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have an idea,” I said staring into the back of his neck, “Forget all about it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He turned to face me, his expression quite bewildered. I jabbed my knife into his jugular with some precision, and enjoyed the brief shower of blood before he sank down to the ground, a lovely pool of crimson steadily growing around him. It didn’t take long before his heart gave up, and he just lay there motionless, his ridiculous moustache now slightly more tolerable tinted red.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that still paint on your clothes?” I said mockingly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hung his body head down from the ceiling with a rope I found in his garage. The last remaining pints of blood dripped into the bucket below, the soothing clanks and glops like chicken soup for the soul. I studied the stain hidden behind his sofa. It would appear I had a leak; the brown-red mush gathering in a stinking pond looking all too familiar. I suspected one of the pipes of my acid tanks needed some fixing. It must have seeped into the foundations, eventually ending up here. Such a shame really; it completely ruined the new hardwood floors.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When night falls I’ll drag his body home and drop it into one of the tanks. It will take two days for the bones to dissolve. That should be enough time to fix the leak and clean up this mess.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I seriously hope the next owner doesn’t have a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hyperobscura/\"&gt;moustache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"After graduating from university, my boyfriend and I started sharing this attic apartment in an old house. Rent wasn't too bad and, while we were a little too far from downtown, at least we had our own bathroom and even a tiny kitchen. Most importantly, the house had its own washing machine and dryer, and since Rafael and I were both tired of dragging our laundry baskets to the nearest laundromat, that actually influenced our decision to move in.\\n\\nNow, I'll admit that every laundry room is a little bit creepy. They're always in the basement, next to noisy boilers that can make some truly blood-curdling sounds. They are humid, cold and just generally unpleasant. This laundry room, though, wasn't too bad because the basement had pretty decent lighting and the machines were brand new. If I tell you now that neither my boyfriend nor I liked to go down to the basement, don't think it was because it was a dark and scary place that brought all of your childhood fears to surface; it was mostly because of the stairs.\\n\\nBecause the house had been split into two separate apartments, plus the attic where we lived, we could only access the basement by going around the house and down a narrow flight of wooden stairs. The steps were a little too short and steep but, other than that, Rafael and I had been rather impressed with the house. We looked around a little bit, commented on how convenient it would be to have a laundry room in the house, then went upstairs again.\\n\\nI had been so distracted talking to Rafael about signing the lease that I almost didn't notice the creeping feeling until it made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.\\n\\nI turned sharply.\\n\\nRafael called me from the door right above me, “You okay there, Mark?”\\n\\nThe landlord, a rather pleasant Philippine man in his sixties, threw me a wary look but said nothing when I answered, “Yeah, it's fine,” before throwing the basement one final look, searching for something out of the ordinary. There was nothing.\\n\\nI couldn't really put it into words at that moment, it happened so fast and so briefly that I just brushed it aside as me being silly.  It wasn't until later that night, when we started packing, that I told Rafael what had been bothering me.\\n\\n“I thought there was someone behind me.”\\n\\nHe looked up from the box he'd been filling with textbooks.\\n\\n“When we were coming out of the basement,” I explained. “I felt like someone was right behind me.”\\n\\n“You too?” he said, a little surprised.\\n\\n“You felt it?”\\n\\n“Yeah. I thought it was you, at first, but then I turned around and you were, like, five steps behind me.”\\n\\n“Did we make a bad decision signing the lease?” I asked, mostly kidding, but not really. “Would be just our luck to end up in a haunted house.”\\n\\n“Fuck ghosts,” Rafa said. “If I never have to share a bathroom with five other people, it will be too soon.”\\n\\nI laughed but couldn't push the uneasiness I was feeling aside. The fact that Rafa didn't look nearly as shook as I felt led me to believe that he hadn't felt exactly the same as I had. The more I thought about it, the harder it became to brush it aside as just a creepy feeling we sometimes get. When was climbing those stairs, I didn't just think there was something behind me; I knew someone was there, trailing in my steps and coming so dangerously close I could almost feel their body against mine, as if I were in a crowd and a stranger were about to collide with me.\\n\\n“You're probably right,” I said, deciding not to think about it. In all likelihood, there was nothing to worry about.\\n\\nI put that out of my mind and didn't think about it until a week after we'd moved into the attic and I had to do the laundry. Despite my initial worry, the memory of being spooked by absolutely nothing had quickly been pushed to the back of my mind as we spent the next couple of weeks packing. I went down to the basement, loaded the washing machine, added the detergent, pressed the button, then started up the stairs wondering what I would do with the next 50 minutes.\\n\\nMy feet had only touched the third step when I felt it again, the certainty – the absolute certainty – that someone was standing right behind me. I stopped to look over my shoulder. There was no one behind me and I felt rather foolish looking back at the washing machine. There was nothing scary here, no one was reaching out with a skeletal hand to pull me back down and take away my soul.\\n\\nI continued up the stairs, trying to ignore the fact that the feeling didn't go away until I opened the door. Then, like a pair of shackles weighing you down, the sensation was gone.\\n\\nAmy, one of the sisters who shared the second floor, was coming back home and she must have seen me shudder because she said, “Spooky, isn't it?”\\n\\n“What?” I asked, a little lost.\\n\\n“The stairs,” she said. “It's okay, everyone feels it. We think there's a friendly ghost living down there or something.”\\n\\n“Seriously?”\\n\\n“Sure. We named him Joe.”\\n\\nShe smiled and I couldn't tell whether she was joking or not.\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Well, if there were any violent crimes in this house, I don't want to hear about them.”\\n\\nIt wasn't that I was particularly superstitious or troubled by the idea of a ghost living downstairs. I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong and that this was not as harmless as I first thought. If I was forced to examine it closely, I might even consider moving.\\n\\nWe didn't, though. Rent was reasonable and our housemates were actually pretty pleasant and quiet people. Rafael and I continued living there for almost a year but we never really got used to the stairs. Amy and her sister, Erin, clearly had, and they made jokes about it and mentioned their friendly ghost as if it were an invisible pet they were fond of. They speculated on the nature of the haunting with gloomy yet gleeful theories.\\n\\n“Maybe some guy killed himself and his ghost is trapped in there.”\\n\\n“Or maybe there are bodies in the walls, or under the stairs.”\\n\\nI didn't think there were bodies hiding anywhere. The floors were made of concrete, the wallpaper hadn't been changed since the 1950s, and the stairs had open steps. The only thing underneath it was a pile of junk the landlord and his wife had accumulated over the years.\\n\\nRafael and I, however, were not horror junkies and took no pleasure talking about the ghost in the basement. Rafael commented on how much he hated those stairs every time he had to go down there and said he was glad at least the rest of the house was peaceful, which was the strangest thing once I thought about it. Nowhere else in the house could we feel a presence, not even a little bit. Nothing ever changed places, no weird noises could be heard in the middle the night, no shadows or strange reflections ever caught us off guard. It was only those damn stairs.\\n\\nAbout six months in, Rafael offered to do all other chores as long as he didn't have to do laundry anymore.\\n\\n“I don't care what it is, I can even do the dishes every day if you want me to, but I'm not going back there,” he told me. He was white as a sheet and I could tell he was barely holding it together.\\n\\n“What happened? Did you see anything?”\\n\\n“It touched me.”\\n\\nHe spoke so softly that I had a difficult time hearing him at first.\\n\\n“What do you mean, it touched you?”\\n\\n“I felt it touch me, Mark. Not like before, it wasn't behind me it... it brushed past me. I swear I could feel their knuckles against the back of my hand.”\\n\\nI tried to tell Rafael that the girls had probably gotten into his head and he had only imagined someone touching him. I told him about the power of suggestion, of how our brain fills the gaps of what it cannot explain with unreasonable facts, at times. Basically, I repeated out loud everything I had been telling myself for six months in order to keep myself sane.\\n\\nRafael told me to go fuck myself with my psychology degree.\\n\\n“You know there's something weird, Mark. You know it, so don't be stubborn.”\\n\\nIt wasn't a long fight, we made up fairly quickly. After that, I took laundry duties upon myself and nothing out of the ordinary happened for a while. Some days, the certainty that someone was following me outside was nothing but a whisper in the back of my mind; other days, it was so strong I actually walked up the stairs backward to keep an eye on the basement. There was never anyone behind me, but I swear I could still feel it standing in front of me, its pace matching mine, its invisible body undeniable even if I couldn't see it. If I closed my mind and put some effort into it, I'm sure I would have been able to picture its face in my mind, but I never did.\\n\\nI just walked faster, taking the stairs two or three steps at a time, not giving whatever it was that lived in the basement the chance to catch up. That was until two months ago when two full loads of laundry meant I was slowed down considerably. As I slugged up the stairs, I could recognize the feeling when it crept up on me, but I told myself it would vanish once I opened the door, it always did. I guess our friendly ghost didn't like going outside.\\n\\nIt came up to me, one step after another. I could tell that its feet dragged at the same pace as mine, as if it, too, were dragging something heavy. It would vanish in a moment, I told myself. It would vanish as soon as I-\\n\\nSomething leaned into my ear. I thought of Rafael and how he'd said he could feel the knuckles of this... person, thing, I don't know, he could feel it touching his skin and, god, now I could feel his fucking lips touching the back of my ear and its icy breath as it whispered, “Thank you.”\\n\\nI dropped the clothes I was carrying and they tumbled down the steps as I ran to the door. I don't think I'd ever been so scared in my life. Strangely, I don't even think it was because of the incorporeal voice whispering in my ear; rather, it was its tone. It sounded almost like a mockery of what gratitude was supposed to sound like, as if it had heard those words in the lips of others several times before and it had learned it with the sole purpose to scare me with it.\\n\\nI asked Amy to go fetch my laundry and then told Rafael that I'd rather use the laundromat two blocks down the street from that moment on. He didn't fight me on it.\\n\\nThe girls asked me about the ghost, dying for some first-hand experience. I answered their questions for five minutes, then told them to never mention it again. It hadn't been funny; it had been fucking terrifying and I didn't want to know what kind of thing had a voice like that. More to the point, I didn't want to know what it was thanking me for. Ignorance was bliss and I wish I could have stayed that way.\\n\\nLast week, our landlord let us know that he would be renovating the basement. He said it was time because the boiler was too old and the place hadn't really gotten a fresh coat of paint in decades. I think, though he never confirmed it, that he thought changing things around, perhaps getting rid of the clutter and the peeling wallpaper, would make a difference and I could only hope it would. Maybe once the renovations were done, I could go downstairs again and realize this whole ordeal had been nothing but a figment of my imagination.\\n\\nSince our landlord and his wife were in their late sixties and not in the best of shapes, the girls offered to move all of the junk he had accumulated in the basement over the years. I can only assume that they wanted to explore the space in more detail, maybe contact the dead while they still had the chance.\\n\\nThat afternoon, Erin knocked on our door. She didn't look disturbed, just a little confused.\\n\\n“Hey, sorry to bother you guys, but can you come downstairs for a moment? We found something a little weird and we thought-”\\n\\n“If you tell me it's a dead body, we'd rather not know,” Rafael said, only half-joking.\\n\\nShe giggled. “No, no, it's nothing serious. It's just... it's kind of strange. Can you take a look?”\\n\\nWe followed Erin downstairs. Her sister was already there, surrounded by a collection of old chests, cardboard boxes, and assorted knickknacks.\\n\\nTurns out the girls had gotten one thing right in their speculation: there was something under the stairs, just not what they'd expected. Just behind a heavy chest, next to the wall, there was a hole big enough for a small person to squeeze out of. I took a closer look, trying to see how far it went and I couldn't begin to tell it. It was very dark, though, so I assume it was rather deep. Around it, we could see deep scratch marks, as if a wild animal with particularly sharp talons had clawed its way out of the hole several times.\\n\\n“What kind of animal can dig a hole in concrete?” Amy asked.\\n\\nI shrugged. “I have no idea.” I was a little relieved, to be honest. Sure, it was a little creepy, but if that hole led outside, then maybe we had all been the victims of a harmless draft and let our imagination get the best of us.\\n\\nRafael said, “Nothing. Nothing can make a whole like that.”\\n\\nI looked at him. He had his eyes on the hole but he didn't look curious or interested in it. Rather, he looked as if he were putting numbers together, trying to reach the solution to a problem.\\n\\n“How long do you think it-” Erin started, but Rafael interrupted her.\\n\\n“We're going upstairs now,” he said, then grabbed me by the hand and forced me up the stairs. When I felt something brushing against my back, I picked up the pace.\\n\\nThe landlord had no idea there was a hole in the basement. The house had been his father's and the basement had stayed relatively untouched for the past twenty years. Rafael insisted that he go downstairs to check but refused to go along with him.\\n\\nHe shuddered when he walked back out a moment later, followed by the girls.\\n\\n“Yeah, that's a... big hole,” he said, looking worried. “It's gonna cost an arm and a leg to fix it.”\\n\\n“Mark and I are moving out,” Rafa said, firmly.\\n\\nThe landlord stared at him. I did the same.\\n\\n“We are very sorry for the short notice, but we can't stay here anymore.”\\n\\nI tried to speak. He ignored me and went on, “We understand that we're breaking the terms of our lease and you can keep our deposit, but we are moving out as soon as we find another place.” He paused. “Honestly, I think you should do the same.”\\n\\nThere was some discussion.

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from university, my boyfriend and I started sharing this attic apartment in an old house. Rent wasn&amp;#39;t too bad and, while we were a little too far from downtown, at least we had our own bathroom and even a tiny kitchen. Most importantly, the house had its own washing machine and dryer, and since Rafael and I were both tired of dragging our laundry baskets to the nearest laundromat, that actually influenced our decision to move in.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;ll admit that every laundry room is a little bit creepy. They&amp;#39;re always in the basement, next to noisy boilers that can make some truly blood-curdling sounds. They are humid, cold and just generally unpleasant. This laundry room, though, wasn&amp;#39;t too bad because the basement had pretty decent lighting and the machines were brand new. If I tell you now that neither my boyfriend nor I liked to go down to the basement, don&amp;#39;t think it was because it was a dark and scary place that brought all of your childhood fears to surface; it was mostly because of the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Because the house had been split into two separate apartments, plus the attic where we lived, we could only access the basement by going around the house and down a narrow flight of wooden stairs. The steps were a little too short and steep but, other than that, Rafael and I had been rather impressed with the house. We looked around a little bit, commented on how convenient it would be to have a laundry room in the house, then went upstairs again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had been so distracted talking to Rafael about signing the lease that I almost didn&amp;#39;t notice the creeping feeling until it made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned sharply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rafael called me from the door right above me, “You okay there, Mark?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The landlord, a rather pleasant Philippine man in his sixties, threw me a wary look but said nothing when I answered, “Yeah, it&amp;#39;s fine,” before throwing the basement one final look, searching for something out of the ordinary. There was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t really put it into words at that moment, it happened so fast and so briefly that I just brushed it aside as me being silly.  It wasn&amp;#39;t until later that night, when we started packing, that I told Rafael what had been bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought there was someone behind me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He looked up from the box he&amp;#39;d been filling with textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“When we were coming out of the basement,” I explained. “I felt like someone was right behind me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You too?” he said, a little surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You felt it?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. I thought it was you, at first, but then I turned around and you were, like, five steps behind me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Did we make a bad decision signing the lease?” I asked, mostly kidding, but not really. “Would be just our luck to end up in a haunted house.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck ghosts,” Rafa said. “If I never have to share a bathroom with five other people, it will be too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I laughed but couldn&amp;#39;t push the uneasiness I was feeling aside. The fact that Rafa didn&amp;#39;t look nearly as shook as I felt led me to believe that he hadn&amp;#39;t felt exactly the same as I had. The more I thought about it, the harder it became to brush it aside as just a creepy feeling we sometimes get. When was climbing those stairs, I didn&amp;#39;t just think there was something behind me; I knew someone was there, trailing in my steps and coming so dangerously close I could almost feel their body against mine, as if I were in a crowd and a stranger were about to collide with me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You&amp;#39;re probably right,” I said, deciding not to think about it. In all likelihood, there was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I put that out of my mind and didn&amp;#39;t think about it until a week after we&amp;#39;d moved into the attic and I had to do the laundry. Despite my initial worry, the memory of being spooked by absolutely nothing had quickly been pushed to the back of my mind as we spent the next couple of weeks packing. I went down to the basement, loaded the washing machine, added the detergent, pressed the button, then started up the stairs wondering what I would do with the next 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My feet had only touched the third step when I felt it again, the certainty – the absolute certainty – that someone was standing right behind me. I stopped to look over my shoulder. There was no one behind me and I felt rather foolish looking back at the washing machine. There was nothing scary here, no one was reaching out with a skeletal hand to pull me back down and take away my soul.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued up the stairs, trying to ignore the fact that the feeling didn&amp;#39;t go away until I opened the door. Then, like a pair of shackles weighing you down, the sensation was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Amy, one of the sisters who shared the second floor, was coming back home and she must have seen me shudder because she said, “Spooky, isn&amp;#39;t it?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked, a little lost.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The stairs,” she said. “It&amp;#39;s okay, everyone feels it. We think there&amp;#39;s a friendly ghost living down there or something.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure. We named him Joe.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled and I couldn&amp;#39;t tell whether she was joking or not.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Right,” I said. “Well, if there were any violent crimes in this house, I don&amp;#39;t want to hear about them.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t that I was particularly superstitious or troubled by the idea of a ghost living downstairs. I just couldn&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that something was wrong and that this was not as harmless as I first thought. If I was forced to examine it closely, I might even consider moving.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t, though. Rent was reasonable and our housemates were actually pretty pleasant and quiet people. Rafael and I continued living there for almost a year but we never really got used to the stairs. Amy and her sister, Erin, clearly had, and they made jokes about it and mentioned their friendly ghost as if it were an invisible pet they were fond of. They speculated on the nature of the haunting with gloomy yet gleeful theories.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Maybe some guy killed himself and his ghost is trapped in there.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe there are bodies in the walls, or under the stairs.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think there were bodies hiding anywhere. The floors were made of concrete, the wallpaper hadn&amp;#39;t been changed since the 1950s, and the stairs had open steps. The only thing underneath it was a pile of junk the landlord and his wife had accumulated over the years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rafael and I, however, were not horror junkies and took no pleasure talking about the ghost in the basement. Rafael commented on how much he hated those stairs every time he had to go down there and said he was glad at least the rest of the house was peaceful, which was the strangest thing once I thought about it. Nowhere else in the house could we feel a presence, not even a little bit. Nothing ever changed places, no weird noises could be heard in the middle the night, no shadows or strange reflections ever caught us off guard. It was only those damn stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About six months in, Rafael offered to do all other chores as long as he didn&amp;#39;t have to do laundry anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;#39;t care what it is, I can even do the dishes every day if you want me to, but I&amp;#39;m not going back there,” he told me. He was white as a sheet and I could tell he was barely holding it together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What happened? Did you see anything?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It touched me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He spoke so softly that I had a difficult time hearing him at first.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean, it touched you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I felt it touch me, Mark. Not like before, it wasn&amp;#39;t behind me it... it brushed past me. I swear I could feel their knuckles against the back of my hand.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to tell Rafael that the girls had probably gotten into his head and he had only imagined someone touching him. I told him about the power of suggestion, of how our brain fills the gaps of what it cannot explain with unreasonable facts, at times. Basically, I repeated out loud everything I had been telling myself for six months in order to keep myself sane.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rafael told me to go fuck myself with my psychology degree.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You know there&amp;#39;s something weird, Mark. You know it, so don&amp;#39;t be stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a long fight, we made up fairly quickly. After that, I took laundry duties upon myself and nothing out of the ordinary happened for a while. Some days, the certainty that someone was following me outside was nothing but a whisper in the back of my mind; other days, it was so strong I actually walked up the stairs backward to keep an eye on the basement. There was never anyone behind me, but I swear I could still feel it standing in front of me, its pace matching mine, its invisible body undeniable even if I couldn&amp;#39;t see it. If I closed my mind and put some effort into it, I&amp;#39;m sure I would have been able to picture its face in my mind, but I never did.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just walked faster, taking the stairs two or three steps at a time, not giving whatever it was that lived in the basement the chance to catch up. That was until two months ago when two full loads of laundry meant I was slowed down considerably. As I slugged up the stairs, I could recognize the feeling when it crept up on me, but I told myself it would vanish once I opened the door, it always did. I guess our friendly ghost didn&amp;#39;t like going outside.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It came up to me, one step after another. I could tell that its feet dragged at the same pace as mine, as if it, too, were dragging something heavy. It would vanish in a moment, I told myself. It would vanish as soon as I-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Something leaned into my ear. I thought of Rafael and how he&amp;#39;d said he could feel the knuckles of this... person, thing, I don&amp;#39;t know, he could feel it touching his skin and, god, now I could feel his fucking lips touching the back of my ear and its icy breath as it whispered, “Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped the clothes I was carrying and they tumbled down the steps as I ran to the door. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d ever been so scared in my life. Strangely, I don&amp;#39;t even think it was because of the incorporeal voice whispering in my ear; rather, it was its tone. It sounded almost like a mockery of what gratitude was supposed to sound like, as if it had heard those words in the lips of others several times before and it had learned it with the sole purpose to scare me with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Amy to go fetch my laundry and then told Rafael that I&amp;#39;d rather use the laundromat two blocks down the street from that moment on. He didn&amp;#39;t fight me on it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The girls asked me about the ghost, dying for some first-hand experience. I answered their questions for five minutes, then told them to never mention it again. It hadn&amp;#39;t been funny; it had been fucking terrifying and I didn&amp;#39;t want to know what kind of thing had a voice like that. More to the point, I didn&amp;#39;t want to know what it was thanking me for. Ignorance was bliss and I wish I could have stayed that way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, our landlord let us know that he would be renovating the basement. He said it was time because the boiler was too old and the place hadn&amp;#39;t really gotten a fresh coat of paint in decades. I think, though he never confirmed it, that he thought changing things around, perhaps getting rid of the clutter and the peeling wallpaper, would make a difference and I could only hope it would. Maybe once the renovations were done, I could go downstairs again and realize this whole ordeal had been nothing but a figment of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Since our landlord and his wife were in their late sixties and not in the best of shapes, the girls offered to move all of the junk he had accumulated in the basement over the years. I can only assume that they wanted to explore the space in more detail, maybe contact the dead while they still had the chance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, Erin knocked on our door. She didn&amp;#39;t look disturbed, just a little confused.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, sorry to bother you guys, but can you come downstairs for a moment? We found something a little weird and we thought-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you tell me it&amp;#39;s a dead body, we&amp;#39;d rather not know,” Rafael said, only half-joking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She giggled. “No, no, it&amp;#39;s nothing serious. It&amp;#39;s just... it&amp;#39;s kind of strange. Can you take a look?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We followed Erin downstairs. Her sister was already there, surrounded by a collection of old chests, cardboard boxes, and assorted knickknacks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out the girls had gotten one thing right in their speculation: there was something under the stairs, just not what they&amp;#39;d expected. Just behind a heavy chest, next to the wall, there was a hole big enough for a small person to squeeze out of. I took a closer look, trying to see how far it went and I couldn&amp;#39;t begin to tell it. It was very dark, though, so I assume it was rather deep. Around it, we could see deep scratch marks, as if a wild animal with particularly sharp talons had clawed its way out of the hole several times.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What kind of animal can dig a hole in concrete?” Amy asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. “I have no idea.” I was a little relieved, to be honest. Sure, it was a little creepy, but if that hole led outside, then maybe we had all been the victims of a harmless draft and let our imagination get the best of us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rafael said, “Nothing. Nothing can make a whole like that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at him. He had his eyes on the hole but he didn&amp;#39;t look curious or interested in it. Rather, he looked as if he were putting numbers together, trying to reach the solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How long do you think it-” Erin started, but Rafael interrupted her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;#39;re going upstairs now,” he said, then grabbed me by the hand and forced me up the stairs. When I felt something brushing against my back, I picked up the pace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The landlord had no idea there was a hole in the basement. The house had been his father&amp;#39;s and the basement had stayed relatively untouched for the past twenty years. Rafael insisted that he go downstairs to check but refused to go along with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He shuddered when he walked back out a moment later, followed by the girls.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, that&amp;#39;s a... big hole,” he said, looking worried. “It&amp;#39;s gonna cost an arm and a leg to fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mark and I are moving out,” Rafa said, firmly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The landlord stared at him. I did the same.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We are very sorry for the short notice, but we can&amp;#39;t stay here anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to speak. He ignored me and went on, “We understand that we&amp;#39;re breaking the terms of our lease and you can keep our deposit, but we are moving out as soon as we find another place.” He paused. “Honestly, I think you should do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was some discussion. Our landlord was actually a pretty nice guy and he liked us because we always pay on time. He also didn&amp;#39;t want to have to find other tenants on such short notice, but Rafael was adamant about it. I was too stunned for words.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The moment we got to our apartment, I exploded, “What the hell, Rafa? We can&amp;#39;t just move-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;#39;re packing.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I couldn&amp;#39;t do much more than just stare at him. “Excuse me?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;#39;re packing, we&amp;#39;re staying at my parents until we find someplace else.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His parents still referred to me as “that boy who&amp;#39;s your roommate”. Spending an undetermined amount of time in their house was not my idea of fun.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Rafa, don&amp;#39;t you think you&amp;#39;re overreacting to a hole on the floor?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched as he bent down to pick our suitcases from under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I said, feeling my patience run thin, “I know that the stairs are creepy and that there were a couple of things that we couldn&amp;#39;t explain, but listen, that hole actually explains a lot. Maybe there are wild animals living in the-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mark, nothing lives in that hole,” he told me, pausing what he was doing to look me in the eye. “I hadn&amp;#39;t thought about it, I don&amp;#39;t know why because it seems rather obvious in retrospect but, I don&amp;#39;t know, I just never realized.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Realized what?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nothing ever follows us back down.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;#39;t care what&amp;#39;s in that hole, Mark,” he said, “but whatever they are, I think we&amp;#39;ve been leading them out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I’d been struggling to sleep lately, and it\\xa0was probably just catching up with me.\\n\\nAt least that’s what I told myself. But no matter what excuses I made,\\xa0something was wrong.

Dragged the little\\xa0time marker back a couple of minutes. As I watched Hugh Argletay\\xa0launch into his roundup of the headlines again, I felt butterflies in\\xa0my stomach.\\n\\nBut not too many.

Threw it on the sofa next to me. I was\\xa0breathing fast, and I could feel my heart thumping in my chest. There\\xa0were no excuses I could make this time. None. I’d listened carefully,\\xa0I’d concentrated, and I was absolutely sure I hadn’t misheard\\xa0anything. Hugh’s advice was different to the first broadcast, but it\\xa0was clear enough.\\n\\n*Whatever you do, don’t look under the bed.*\\n\\nFrom upstairs, I heard the soft creak of a floorboard.\\n\\nI froze. Every nerve in my body suddenly tingled. I held my breath and\\xa0stayed as still as I could, straining my ears over the sound of my\\xa0pounding heartbeat.\\n\\nNothing. No more noises. No more creaks.\\n\\n\"You’re imagining it, that’s all,\" I told myself. \"All of it. It’s\\xa0just your tired mind playing tricks on you.\"\\n\\nBut I suddenly found a horrible image pushing its way into my head:\\xa0the image of a man upstairs, hiding in the darkness. His eyes and\\xa0teeth glinting in the shadows beneath my bed. His fingers tightening\\xa0around the wooden handle of a meat cleaver as he waited for the sound\\xa0of my footsteps on the stairs...\\n\\nI shook the image off. My hands felt hot and sweaty. As I picked up my\\xa0phone in a desperate attempt to distract myself, my fingers slipped\\xa0across its surface.\\n\\nI unlocked it on the third attempt. Had to wipe my right hand on my\\xa0jeans before the thing would recognise my thumb print. With the screen\\xa0unlocked I tapped on a random news app without thinking.\\n\\nA list of stories appeared in front of me. My eyes scanned down it.\\xa0This was more like it. The top of the app was filled with\\xa0entertainment news and celebrity gossip. Mindless stuff. As I scrolled\\xa0down past the latest headlines, my heart rate gradually began to slow.\\xa0I started feeling less afraid.\\n\\nBut of course, it didn’t last. About halfway down the page, I came\\xa0across a headline that read:\\n\\n*\"Meat Cleaver Killer\" claims third victim as police widen search*\\n\\nI scrolled quickly past it.\\n\\nAnd as I did, that same creeping dread began to shift and roll in my\\xa0stomach once more. Because it was happening again. The same\\xa0inexplicable stuff I’d seen on the TV, and on my laptop.\\n\\nThe next headline that caught my eye was this:\\n\\n*Police advise residents who live alone to leave the house as quickly as possible*\\n\\nThe one directly below it read:\\n\\n*Is the \"Meat Cleaver Killer\" closer than you think?*\\n\\nAnd finally, just below that one:\\n\\n*Whatever you do, Sam, don’t look under the bed*\\n\\nThe name of that last article’s author was Hugh Argletay.\\n\\nI locked my phone and placed it on the coffee table. My hands were\\xa0shaking. Something fragile in my mind was starting to bend. It hadn’t\\xa0snapped — not yet, at least — but it was close. I could feel it. Close\\xa0to breaking point.\\n\\nAnd as I sat there on my sofa, I knew exactly what I needed to do.\\n\\nI had to go upstairs and check the bedroom. I had to do what the news\\xa0was telling me not to.\\n\\nBecause there was no man hiding under the bed really, was there? It\\xa0was all in my mind. It had to be. It was paranoia brought on by fear\\xa0and lack of sleep.\\n\\nI stood up and walked to the bottom of the stairs. They stretched up\\xa0into darkness. My skin felt itchy with sweat. My heart beat like a\\xa0trapped animal in a cage. I strained my ears for any sound upstairs —\\xa0any more creaking floorboards — but I couldn’t hear a thing. So I\\xa0began to climb.\\n\\nThe walk up the steps, and down the hall to my closed bedroom door,\\xa0felt like a dream. A nightmare. I didn’t want to go in that room. Not\\xa0at all. I knew there was nothing be afraid of — not rationally — but\\xa0the thought didn’t help. Dread consumed me. Despite how I felt,\\xa0though, I couldn’t see any alternative to confronting it head on.\\n\\nI took a breath and pushed open the bedroom door. It creaked inwards.\\xa0My room was a nest of shadows. The curtains were drawn across the\\xa0window, and the darkness made everything look sinister. My wardrobe\\xa0and chest of drawers hunched in the blackness like monsters ready to\\xa0pounce. I reached around the doorway, my hand shaking, and flicked the\\xa0switch.\\n\\nLight spilled into the room. Its brightness made me squint. It\\xa0banished most of the shadows, but not all of them. As I stood in the\\xa0doorway, quickly scanning the area for any signs of movement, my eyes\\xa0came to rest on the bed. At the slither of darkness just visible\\xa0beneath it.\\n\\nMy bed rested against the wall at the far end of the room. A nice big\\xa0double. From my current angle, I couldn’t see underneath it. Not\\xa0properly. I knew I’d have to go in for a closer look.\\n\\nThe floorboards creaked as I moved across the room. Each sound made me\\xa0wince. The dread in my stomach rolled and churned. My mind continued\\xa0to bend beneath an enormous weight of fear.\\n\\nAnd as I got closer to the bed, something started to happen. All the\\xa0unusual things I’d heard and seen in the news began rushing through my\\xa0head. A barrage of words and sounds. The longer it went on, the more a\\xa0strange conviction grew in my mind: that I was seeing the pieces of a\\xa0puzzle I hadn’t quite managed to fit together yet. A puzzle that it\\xa0might be better if I didn’t solve.\\n\\n*If your name happens to be Sam, we’d advise you take extra care.*\\n\\n*Is the Meat Cleaver Killer closer than you think?*\\n\\n*Whatever you do, don’t look under the bed.*\\n\\nThe words whirled faster and faster in my mind. I was standing in\\xa0front of the bed now. As the dread and terror inside me reached a\\xa0crescendo, I lowered myself to my knees.\\n\\nAnd I peeked under it.\\n\\n*Click*. The final piece of the puzzle suddenly slotted into place.\\n\\nHugh Argletay. The news anchor I’d never seen or heard of before. I\\xa0said his name again in my mind. More slowly this time.\\n\\nHugh Argletay.\\n\\nHugh. Ar. Gle. Tay.\\n\\nAs I spoke the syllables and peered into the shadows beneath the bed,\\xa0I felt a fragile part of my mind tear in two.\\n\\nThere was no man hiding in the darkness. There was only a plastic bag.\\xa0And as I reached into the shadows and grasped hold of it, I already\\xa0knew what it contained.\\n\\nI pulled the bag out into the light. Heard it scrape across the\\xa0floorboards. Took a breath and opened it.\\n\\nInside was a stained meat cleaver and the bloody, severed stumps of\\xa0[three fingers](https://www.reddit.com/r/samhaysom/).',\n",

There was only a plastic bag.\\xa0And as I reached into the shadows and grasped hold of it, I already\\xa0knew what it contained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled the bag out into the light. Heard it scrape across the\\xa0floorboards.

My mouth is gasping as panic sets in and my muscles are screaming as the blood in my veins does not budge.  I reach out upward, unsure of what I’m reaching for as Theodora’s face comes into view.  \\n\\nShe breathes into my mouth, my lungs filling with air, and compresses my chest.  Each compression is slower and slower and the other two soldiers are shouting something or other at Underhill, but a ringing in my ears keeps me from hearing what they’re saying.\\n\\nThe scene changes and I’m standing up, the pain numbed.  I look around and I see I’m near my firing station.\\n\\nGabriel is standing there, their arms crossed over their chest, their scythe held tightly against them as they watch the scene of Theodora giving me chest compressions in slow motion. \\n\\n“The rescue breaths aren’t needed; your blood circulation needs to improve first.” \\n\\nI moved towards Gabriel.  “Why do you say that?”\\n\\nGabriel turned to me nonchalantly.  “Your heart stopped.” \\n\\nMy head shakes. “No, I mean that comment.  I’m aware my heart stopped.”\\n\\n“Comment?” Gabriel asked, their attention shifting back to the scene of me on the floor as Theodora gave another set of rescue breaths.  I noticed that Gabriel’s wings shifted as Theodora breathed into my lungs.\\n\\n“Are you jealous?” I asked.\\n\\n“Excuse me?” Gabriel said, surprised their attention now on me.  “Jealous?  Of what!  Her?”  They  motioned to Theodora, “I…” Gabriel clears their throat, “Whomever you lay with is your business, Elon.” \\n\\nI lean against my firing station next to Gabriel. “You are jealous, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“Envy is a sin,” Gabriel said, not taking their eyes off of Theodora. “And, honestly, I’ve nothing to be envious about.” They turned to me. “She’s a rather brutish woman.  You’ve already shown her no interest.” \\n\\nAs I glance back to the scene and smile mischievously.   “I might owe her after she saved my life.” \\n\\n“I’m the one who saved your life!” Gabriel protested, “It’s me keeping you alive, Elon!  Without me, that poison would overwhelm you.  I could take you now if I so choose, and there wouldn’t be a damned thing she could do about it!” \\n\\n“I’m not saying I don’t owe you my life.” Forgetting for a moment who I was talking to, I cleared my throat.  “I’m saying, she won’t see it that way, she is very certain she’s saving me.  She doesn’t know about you.”\\n\\nThe scene now had Dr. Underhill tilting my head back and pouring the red liquid inside.  Theodora continued the chest compressions.\\n\\nGabriel turned to me as the world began to come back to normal, their form fading, “I saved you and I ask for nothing in return.” \\n\\nGabriel faded as time began to filter back to normal.\\n\\n“And I thank you for that.”\\n\\n“I still don’t know why” was the last thing Gabriel said before all I could see was the ceiling.\\n\\nMy heart is pumping again and I gasp for air as it does.\\n\\n“Oh, thank the Gods!” Theodora shouted. “You’re cold!” she said as she placed her hand to my forehead. “You okay?”\\n\\nDr. Underhill sat me up. “On your feet, boy,” he grumbled.  “Next time, don’t miss your dose.” He taunted me with the red vial, now empty.\\n\\nI coughed and groaned.  \\n\\nOne of the other soldiers asked, “Sir, what happened to him, sir?”\\n\\n“His heart stopped,” Dr. Underhill said as he got me to my feet.\\n\\nThe other soldier shouted, “Bullshit!  You cannot recover from a cardiac arrest like that!  He was on the floor for a good minute!” \\n\\nTheodora turned to the second soldier. “Is the Lt. General a lower rank than you, private?”\\n\\nHe stammered, “Well, no but…” \\n\\nTheodora walked over to him and socked him in the gut, winding him and sending him to his knees.   “We do not tolerate Insubordination.  Where I hail from, I’d order you to run, naked, for hours.” \\n\\nThe soldier was on his hands and knees, gasping.\\n\\n“Ms. Rigas, as much as I appreciate the sentiment, I will discipline my soldiers.  Thank you.” \\n\\nTheodora nodded, and scoffed to the soldier, “You’re weak, square up soldier, it was a damn love tap.”\\n\\n“Good to see even the governing body of Penthesil still holds true to the title of Valkyrie,” Dr. Underhill said.\\n\\nI was now steadier as I turned to Theodora.  “Thanks.”\\n\\n“Oh, you’re welcome, can’t have a specimen like yourself dying—it would be a shame to the entire gene pool.” She gave me a creepy grin and eyed me up and down.\\n\\nI’ve never known what it was like to be on the receiving end of someone ogling you, but I’ll say this: I didn’t like it. \\n\\nTheodora turned to Dr. Underhill.  “I have to ask, doctor, how did he recover?  It completely stopped his heart.” \\n\\n“Private Winter’s training has been pushing his body’s limits to how starved for oxygen his cells can be.  As he goes through more training and treatment, his body has grown more adept at coping with lower levels of oxygen.  The normal cell death that would occur in a person’s body should they suffer a heart failure did not occur as it would.”  Dr. Underhill paused, “It may have, given another ten to twenty minute.   Luckily you got his heart going, for that I thank you.” \\n\\nDespite whatever Dr. Underhill had explained, my head was pounding. “I think one death is enough for today… right?” \\n\\nDr. Underhill scoffed and waved me off.  “Like that is an excuse to break from your training.”\\n\\nTheodora intervened. “Dr. Underhill, regardless of him being your soldier, and patient, the man just recovered from a heart attack—it’s clear to me he needs a break.  Why not release him to me for the afternoon for R&amp;R?”  \\n\\n“I see little to no reason to do so,” Dr. Underhill argued.  \\n\\n“I’ll remind you I am only here as a foreign dignitary and not as someone delivering prototype weapons to a secret government project.” Theodora grinned, “I could take the weapons back.”\\n\\n“This seems like extortion,” I complained.\\n\\n“It is, and you have very little say in it,” Dr. Underhill grumbled. “Fine, take the boy for the day.”\\n\\nTheodora looked to me hungrily. “Oh, I will.”\\n\\nI think I’d rather be suffering at my firing station at this point.  \\n\\nTheodora took me by the shoulder and led me out of the firing range.  Once we were out of earshot, she gave a concerned glance to me. “Are you okay?  Your superior officer doesn’t seem to care for your well being.”\\n\\nI grumbled, “He’s a demon.” \\n\\nTheodora stifled a laugh. “I have a friend of mine who would love to kill him if it were true.”\\n\\nThis caught my attention. “You have a demon-slaying friend?”\\n\\nTheodora nods to me, “Oh yes.  How’s this: you meet me in two hours outside the base and I can tell you all about her and myself.” She gave me another predatory grin.  “I realize I didn’t catch your full name, Private.”\\n\\n“Private Elon Winter,” I responded.\\n\\nTheodora’s eyebrow rose. “Winter… where have I heard that name before?”\\n\\nI shrugged, “I guess I’ll see you later,” I made my way back to my quarters.  If I would be wandering about with a foreign dignitary, I should be in my uniform.  She was in hers after all. \\n\\n…\\n\\nTwo hours later I was walking out front when a limo pulled up with a strange flag I’d never seen before over it.  It was a white flag with a blue eye over it and some kind of golden belt under that. \\n\\nI was in my full uniform and with the limo, it at least seemed appropriate.  \\n\\nTheodora climbed out of the limo awkwardly and adjusted her breastplate, smiling at me, “Very fetching. ” She grinned at me.  “We have a lot to discuss.”\\n\\nI climbed into the limo and settled inside. \\n\\nTheodora did the same, the limo shifting from her weight as she climbed in.  She sat down, her legs extended out in front of her rather than bent, mostly because of her size and the height of the limo.  “Drawbacks of being taller than the average population,” she explained, as she leaned over to me. “Shame it’s not a Saturday.”\\n\\n“Why?” I asked her, worrying where this conversation was heading.\\n\\n“On Saturday, I love to watch MMA fights.  Whenever I’m around here, I try to plan it for fight night,” she explained.\\n\\nI’ve been to this place before and I had a sense of where this was going.  \\n\\n“Your father was Barry ‘The Beast’ Winter, wasn’t he?” \\n\\nI heaved a sigh.  “Yes,” I admitted.\\n\\nTheodora was full of energy. “I knew it!  Oh, your father was amazing in his prime!” she gushed.  “Though, I really need to ask, wouldn’t Barry ‘The Blizzard’ Winter have worked better?  I mean… ‘The Best’ is still an awesome title but, the ‘Blizzard’ thing would have worked better,  right?” \\n\\n“I’d rather not discuss my father,” I said flatly. \\n\\nTheodora seemed taken back. “Oh?  Why is that?  I know he’s retired, but I always thought his contract buy-out was unjust… merely for killing someone in the ring.  A part of the rhetoric is to protect oneself at all times.  It was unfair what happened to him, considering the circumstances.” \\n\\n“Again, I don’t enjoy discussing my late father, please,” I begged.\\n\\nTheodora appeared shocked. “He passed?  I’m sorry!  I hadn’t heard.  I thought I would have.”  She frowned. “I won’t bring it up again, I promise.  I’m so sorry.” \\n\\nI frowned. “Wait, you didn’t know he died?”\\n\\n“I thought it would be in the news but I must have missed it.   I didn’t, I swear.” She placed her hand on my shoulder. “You must miss him.”\\n\\n“He’s with God now,” I said.\\n\\nAn audible whimper from somewhere nearby, not from Theodora, echoed through the air and a chill ran down my spine.  I wriggled my finger into my ear to clear it.\\n\\n“Sorry, this is beginning on a downer note,” Theodora explained.  “Still… I’m sure you’re in the mood for something to eat?”\\n\\n“I’m an eighteen-year-old soldier.  Don’t expect me to be buying if it’s a meal to match the limo.” \\n\\nTheodora chuckled. “I’m the one taking you out.” She sighed. “The culture here is so backward.” \\n\\nTheodora’s breastplate armor, her size, and her flag finally got to me, and as much as I feared she would take the question as an interest in her, my curiosity was getting the better of me.  “What culture are you from?”\\n\\n“I’m unsurprised you’re unaware of it.”  She sighed.  “From Greece to Persia, my people were once feared and mighty.  History, of course, doesn’t enjoy hearing of the shield maidens of Greece or the horseback archers of Persia.  The idea was unsettling to many men.  That their wives could somehow take up arms against them and so forth,” she scoffed. “Could you imagine if the women of Iran knew of their proud heritage?”  She shook her head.  “Regardless of that heritage, I hail from a small city-state known as Penthesil, currently in Central America, right between Panama and Columbia.” \\n\\n“City-state?” I ask, perplexed.\\n\\n“Yes, a grand city too.” She smiled. “Inspired by Rome, the city is large, sprawling, and most importantly guarded.  It’s very different from here, everything is firm concrete vs wood and cardboard.” She sighed. “Granted, the walls are constrictive.  Decades ago we had to move the farms out to build new housing.  The men seem pleased enough at that though.” \\n\\n“Sounds interesting.  I’d love to see it,” I lied.\\n\\n“Oh, no you never can or will,” she explained. “Pentasil has, despite whining from the farmers and livestock owners on the outside, a strict tradition of barring men from within their walls.”   \\n\\n“They only fill the city with women?” \\n\\nTheodora nods. “Yes.  Gives us time to govern without having to listen to the simpering of the opposite sex.” \\n\\n“How progressive,  I said, “Where do the men live?”\\n\\n“Outside of the walls, there are farms and villages the men live in.  There they are perfectly free and live happy lives,” she explained, “At least they should be.  There’s always someone whining.” \\n\\n“You’re… you said a steward?” \\n\\nShe nods. “I am the heir to the stewardship, second only to the queen’s line, which is a part of the great Queen Penthesilea’s lineage.  My mother traces her own heritage back to Persian Amazons of old.  While not technically royalty, her family proved beyond any doubt to be as capable, if not more so, than any other Valkyrie.” \\n\\n“You’re kind of mixing things on me,” I said, confused. “I thought Amazons were Greek, and that Valkyrie was like… well, Vikings and stuff.” \\n\\nTheodora nods    “Yes.  In the same way, America is an allegation of multiple cultures, so are my people.  Our story began at the end of the battle of Troy.  After the tragic death of Queen Penthesilea, her niece Oterå, daughter of Hippolyta, gathered up the Greek tribes, and made alliances with the Persian warriors, and set forth to begin anew.  With Oterå being the last of a royal line, and the army suffering a tragic defeat at Troy, they had great difficulty making a living in the Mediterranian.” She stretched her legs, “While our tribe moved about, leaving our homeland as marauding armies took hold, we dwindled in number, but never vanished.  That was when our great Queen Melainppe the eighth, had a vision from the gods.”\\n\\n“A vision?  When was this?” I asked, never having heard any of it and wondering how much was fairytales and what was real. \\n\\n“10th centuries, if I remember,” Theodora clarified. “But the vision promised life in a new land.” She chuckled. “They lost half the ships that set sail at sea, but the few that remained landed in what we think is modern-day Carolina.” \\n\\n“There are two of those.” I corrected, “North and South.” \\n\\n“Well, we aren’t too sure which, the records aren’t perfect and the description of the coast was… iffy, let's say.” Theodora smiled at me, “By then they barely considered us Amazons, or as the native’s of the land referred to us ‘the Great Eagle Women’.”  \\n\\n“Still doesn’t explain the Valkyrie thing.” I pointed out.\\n\\nTheodora nods.  “At the time we were trying to eke out a living in the new land — it was fairly harsh, and we had no true place.  We had found plenty of iron ore nearby to help us make weapons, but the farming was subpar… likely because we lost our farmers to the sea.  We did, however, establish decent relations with the natives.  They had a large demand for our arrowheads and spearheads: so we had no issue smithing these to barter for food.” She grinned. “The raiding parties arrived, and changed everything.”\\n\\n“Raiding parties?” I asked, confused.  \\n\\n“Great warriors from the north had landed on the coast.  Brutal men, some called them giants, and word reached us through our native trade partners of farmland being razed, villages being destroyed, and most heinous, women being raped by the invaders.” She grinned, “And Queen Melainppe’s youngest daughter, Antiope, would have none of that.  She marched the troops to meet the raiding Viking parties, and defeated them in the field, but barely.”\\n\\n“Doesn’t sound like a supreme victory,” I said.\\n\\n“Far from it, the warriors we had barely survived, and only did so because of a home field advantage, and support from the native peoples.” she smiled, “Princess Antiope was beside herself with rage!  Princess Antiope was beside herself that these men, fresh off of a boat, could come so close to defeating her despite her superior tactics, weapons, and numbers.  She established our oldest and most sacred tradition.” she leered at me, “Care to guess what it is?” \\n\\n“I’m… completely unsure.”\\n\\nTheodora rolled her eyes, “Princess Antiope came upon one of the injured Vikings and set herself to rape the man for hours.  She commanded her best warriors to do the same, taking the prisoners of war, and forcing themselves on them for days.  Princess Antiope said she would take the spoils of war, by ensuring they took the physical strength of our attackers for our future generations.” \\n\\n“So… Princess Antiope, who was mad about hearing about women being raped, raped the Vikings?” I asked.\\n\\n“Justice, as she had put it.  That led to the War of Generations.” She smiled proudly. “For five generations, it became a tradition for warrior women to travel up the coast, as a rite of passage, and sack a Viking encampment.  They chose only the strongest warriors to go, and only the strongest Vikings were chosen by the warriors.  Our losses dwindled each generation, as we grew stronger and more discerning about who was sent and who returned with what.  By the end, the Vikings left, declaring the Americas ‘the land of the Valkyrie’.  After so long there were no new Vikings coming, and as such, we continued the tradition every four years, using the sons they bore as our new raids.” \\n\\n“I am clarifying that you… raped men for their seed, for five generations?”\\n\\nTheodora nodded, “We did it for over five generations.  Our hunt for warriors led us down south, until finally upon finding no new conquests, we settled in present-day Penthesil.  We built the city with the express purpose of not allowing men.” She chuckled. “Our joke was that the men kept giving us such poor directions that we declared that we would remain where we were that day and that we cast them out.”\\n\\n“And the raping continued?” I asked.\\n\\nTheodora laughed. “Oh calm down… the men’s liberation movement started up in the 1950s — Championed by Queen Takisha.  While we used to raid the nearby villages, now the act is entirely ceremonial.  The men choose their own volunteers who take part, our strongest warriors are still chosen, and they mock battle in what is basically matchmaking.” She frowned. “Now, of course, the men want consent… takes the fun out of it in my opinion.” \\n\\n“Yeah… all that consensual sex sure puts a damper on things…” \\n\\n“You’re biased, of course.” She grinned. “Besides, I’d need consent from you.” \\n\\nThe Limo came to a stop.\\n\\n“Thus the dinner,” she explained, opening the door for me, “after you.” She pulled her legs up against herself to allow me to exit.\\n\\nI missed playing near death at the firing range, heck I longed for it.  I got out of the Limo and was surprised to see we were at a small Mexican restaurant.  \\n\\n“Hope you like spicy food,” Theodora said as she stepped out of the Limo.\\n\\n…\\n\\nAt the restaurant, I had got a little more information from Theodora, mostly about her demon slaying friend. “Your friend… the demon slayer… can you tell me about her?”\\n\\nTheodora rolled her eyes, her elbows on the table, head resting on her hands. “You’re full of questions, aren’t you?” \\n\\n*Whatever can keep this conversation off of me…* I thought to myself.  \\n\\n“Ugh… It’s an in-joke between us.  She’s obsessed with this anime about this guy with a ridiculous sword who runs around slicing demons in half and decapitating people.  The sword is ridiculous too, no human could ever hold this thing and yet the guy swings around what has to be a two-hundred-kilogram sword like its nothing — with one hand, no less!” she laughed. \\n\\n“I have no clue how heavy two hundred kilograms is,” I said. “But I assume that’s heavy.”\\n\\n“You’re barely half that, I bet.” She grinned.  “I could pick you up and take a guess at your weight tho.” She flexed her arm, showing an impressive bulge under her uniform. “I’ve got a good handle on how much I can lift.” \\n\\nI try to guide the topic back to the original question. “So, heavy enough to be impossible to use.”\\n\\nTheodora nods. “Yes, though if anyone could swing something like it with any real effect, it would be Zepherina.  She’s the strongest person on this planet.”  \\n\\n“You mean, the strongest woman?”\\n\\nTheodora shook her head. “No, Zepherina is the strongest person on this earth.  I’ve seen her do things that strong men struggle to do, and they’re record-breaking.  She has strong genes, being the second princess and all, but still.” She gets a dreamy look in her eyes, “She’s incredible.” \\n\\nMy escape was all but guaranteed. “So… you have a thing for her.  Are you, bi?” \\n\\nTheodora sighed. “Americans… you treat sexuality like it has a definition.” She looked to me “Men are for one thing: Procreation.  That’s pretty much my only desire with you, no offense.” \\n\\n“Just telling me kills it for you though, doesn’t it?” I ask.\\n\\n“Oh please… I blew it in the limo when I mentioned your father.” She smiles. “I’ve been entertaining you to make up for my blatant disregard for your feelings, and for the respect of your family.” \\n\\n“So no Snu Snu then?” I grin.\\n\\n“No ‘Snu Snu,” she chuckles.  \\n\\n“But the princess, you like her?” I ask.\\n\\n“I do, I long for the most perfect date: me and her, at the end of a victorious battle, embracing in celebration… then kissing deeply and spending the evening reveling in each other’s bodies.” Her face is flushed now, and she looks down, dejected, “except she says she has no interest in me.”\\n\\n“Ouch.”\\n\\n“Yeah… I don’t think she realized how much it hurt.  She’s still my closest friend, and I hold out hope that her mind will change.  But at the same time, I think I know how she feels.  It’s a one-way thing… for now, anyway.  Zepherina seems to want nothing more than to fight, I don’t think romance is on her mind in the slightest.” \\n\\n“Sounds like a heck of a warrior princess,” I said, taking a drink. \\n\\n“Zepherina, honestly, should rule.  She’s second in line to Queen Rachel’s throne… Evangeline is the first and, in all honesty, has no qualities to rule or bear children suitable for the throne.” \\n\\n“Why is that?” I asked.\\n\\n“She’s a pipsqueak for one, shorter than you, and arrogant.  A real Napoléon complex… and she’s just like her mother, which is… bad.” \\n\\n“You don’t approve of the current queen?”\\n\\nTheodora looks to me, around us, and back again, “No, few do.  She’s a monster.  Paranoid of her power, and of those who may want to overthrow her.  She has decreed that any challenge for her throne is to bet to the death, and she’s never too graceful to the loser.” \\n\\n“What happens to the loser?” I questioned, worried.\\n\\n“The last one who challenged her suffered a defeat in a record time of only thirty seconds. Queen Rachel tore her arm clean off.”  Theodora shuddered. “Queen Rachel was furious that someone so weak believed they could rule that she ordered her other limbs surgically removed, and her, still living, thrown into a lake and left for dead.” \\n\\n“Holy shit.  Please tell me that’s like… ancient times or something.” I shivered at the thought of being limbless, floating in the water, trying not to drown, or maybe hoping that you did.  Can you swim without your arms and legs?  What would happen if you reached the shore?  What then?  If the lake is in the middle of nowhere how do you manage? Just writhe about until you can find shelter?  Food?  How long could you last as a quadriplegic if they abandoned you? \\n\\n“That was about five years ago.” She frowned.“I’m just saying this because of how far I am from home, and from Queen Rachel’s reach.   Even the challenger's family fled after the defeat, exiling themselves willingly for fear of what Rachel would have done to them.” \\n\\n“So… you want Zepherina to be queen because she’s different?” \\n\\nTheodora nods.  “Zepherina reminds many of her Grandmother, Queen Takisha.  Queen Takisha was just and wise, and though she vanished for what seemed like decades, she returned wise and learned… but carrying with her a child, and that child was Queen Rachel.” She stretched as she took a long drink from her bottle of beer.  “It’s said Rachel went on a similar quest as Queen Takisha did, but she came back bitter, vicious, and with a little girl, Evangeline, and carrying Zepherina.  No one knows where the father came from, as none of the villagers ever saw Queen Rachel—so where Evangeline and Zepherina get their lineage is completely unknown.  Hell, the only reason everyone knows Eva is Rachel’s is because of her wi-” Theodora interrupted herself, “will… her strong will.”  \\n\\n“There seems to be some conspiracy there.  Does it really matter who the father is?” \\n\\nTheodora smiles at me. “It’s said there are two: Some say Evangeline is the daughter of the Devil and Rachel, that they made a dark pact.   While Zepherina is the daughter of Athena, who gave Rachel an immaculate birth.” \\n\\n“Is this Princess Evangeline that bad?  I mean… outside of her arrogance?  It can be tough being the short kid in school: you gotta pick fights to stay ahead of the pack and get respect.” I kind of felt for Evangeline.\\n\\nTheodora was taken aback, “I’ve heard no one defend her outside of Zepherina, and I just assumed that was a sisterhood thing.” She shook her head.  “But you’ve never met her.  You’d see it in her eyes, she has the same eyes as her mother.  Those same cold ice-blue eyes.” \\n\\n…\\n\\n“Thanks for the break,” I said as Theodora returned me to the base.\\n\\n“Anytime… I may swing by to see you again if I’m in the neighborhood.” She grin., “Maybe I’ll have better luck next time.”\\n\\n“Don’t count on it!” I said, waving as she drove off. As I walked back to the base, I saw General Drake inside, and to my shock, standing next to him was Demond, looking far meaner than I had ever seen him.\\n\\n“The man of the hour,” General Drake said as he noticed me.  \\n\\n“About fuckin’ time,” Demond almost growled.  I noticed his eyes were now yellow.  \\n\\n“What’s going on?” I asked.\\n\\nDemond spoke shortly.   “We’re shipping out, the two of us.  Get your gear and let's get killing.” \\n\\n“Lieutenant, watch your tone,” General Drake said, turning him \\n\\nDemond turned to General Drake and glared at him, his hair turning white and his gritted teeth lengthening.\\n\\nBefore I even knew what was happening, General Drake had a gun pointed point blank into Demond’s chest.   \\n “Lieutenant… I have no intention of becoming another victim of yours.” He pulled the hammer back on the pistol.  “Back down or Project Winter ends right now.”  He glanced at me. “For the both [of](https://www.facebook.com/DevlinRiptide) [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).”\",\n",

My mouth is gasping as panic sets in and my muscles are screaming as the blood in my veins does not budge.  I reach out upward, unsure of what I’m reaching for as Theodora’s face comes into view.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She breathes into my mouth, my lungs filling with air, and compresses my chest.  Each compression is slower and slower and the other two soldiers are shouting something or other at Underhill, but a ringing in my ears keeps me from hearing what they’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The scene changes and I’m standing up, the pain numbed.  I look around and I see I’m near my firing station.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gabriel is standing there, their arms crossed over their chest, their scythe held tightly against them as they watch the scene of Theodora giving me chest compressions in slow motion. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The rescue breaths aren’t needed; your blood circulation needs to improve first.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I moved towards Gabriel.  “Why do you say that?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gabriel turned to me nonchalantly.  “Your heart stopped.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My head shakes. “No, I mean that comment.  I’m aware my heart stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Comment?” Gabriel asked, their attention shifting back to the scene of me on the floor as Theodora gave another set of rescue breaths.  I noticed that Gabriel’s wings shifted as Theodora breathed into my lungs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you jealous?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Excuse me?” Gabriel said, surprised their attention now on me.  “Jealous?  Of what!  Her?”  They  motioned to Theodora, “I…” Gabriel clears their throat, “Whomever you lay with is your business, Elon.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lean against my firing station next to Gabriel. “You are jealous, aren’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Envy is a sin,” Gabriel said, not taking their eyes off of Theodora. “And, honestly, I’ve nothing to be envious about.” They turned to me. “She’s a rather brutish woman.  You’ve already shown her no interest.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I glance back to the scene and smile mischievously.   “I might owe her after she saved my life.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m the one who saved your life!” Gabriel protested, “It’s me keeping you alive, Elon!  Without me, that poison would overwhelm you.  I could take you now if I so choose, and there wouldn’t be a damned thing she could do about it!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m not saying I don’t owe you my life.” Forgetting for a moment who I was talking to, I cleared my throat.  “I’m saying, she won’t see it that way, she is very certain she’s saving me.  She doesn’t know about you.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The scene now had Dr. Underhill tilting my head back and pouring the red liquid inside.  Theodora continued the chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gabriel turned to me as the world began to come back to normal, their form fading, “I saved you and I ask for nothing in return.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gabriel faded as time began to filter back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And I thank you for that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t know why” was the last thing Gabriel said before all I could see was the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart is pumping again and I gasp for air as it does.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, thank the Gods!” Theodora shouted. “You’re cold!” she said as she placed her hand to my forehead. “You okay?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Underhill sat me up. “On your feet, boy,” he grumbled.  “Next time, don’t miss your dose.” He taunted me with the red vial, now empty.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I coughed and groaned.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the other soldiers asked, “Sir, what happened to him, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“His heart stopped,” Dr. Underhill said as he got me to my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The other soldier shouted, “Bullshit!  You cannot recover from a cardiac arrest like that!  He was on the floor for a good minute!” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora turned to the second soldier. “Is the Lt. General a lower rank than you, private?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He stammered, “Well, no but…” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora walked over to him and socked him in the gut, winding him and sending him to his knees.   “We do not tolerate Insubordination.  Where I hail from, I’d order you to run, naked, for hours.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The soldier was on his hands and knees, gasping.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ms. Rigas, as much as I appreciate the sentiment, I will discipline my soldiers.  Thank you.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nodded, and scoffed to the soldier, “You’re weak, square up soldier, it was a damn love tap.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Good to see even the governing body of Penthesil still holds true to the title of Valkyrie,” Dr. Underhill said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was now steadier as I turned to Theodora.  “Thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, you’re welcome, can’t have a specimen like yourself dying—it would be a shame to the entire gene pool.” She gave me a creepy grin and eyed me up and down.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never known what it was like to be on the receiving end of someone ogling you, but I’ll say this: I didn’t like it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora turned to Dr. Underhill.  “I have to ask, doctor, how did he recover?  It completely stopped his heart.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Private Winter’s training has been pushing his body’s limits to how starved for oxygen his cells can be.  As he goes through more training and treatment, his body has grown more adept at coping with lower levels of oxygen.  The normal cell death that would occur in a person’s body should they suffer a heart failure did not occur as it would.”  Dr. Underhill paused, “It may have, given another ten to twenty minute.   Luckily you got his heart going, for that I thank you.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite whatever Dr. Underhill had explained, my head was pounding. “I think one death is enough for today… right?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Underhill scoffed and waved me off.  “Like that is an excuse to break from your training.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora intervened. “Dr. Underhill, regardless of him being your soldier, and patient, the man just recovered from a heart attack—it’s clear to me he needs a break.  Why not release him to me for the afternoon for R&amp;amp;R?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I see little to no reason to do so,” Dr. Underhill argued.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll remind you I am only here as a foreign dignitary and not as someone delivering prototype weapons to a secret government project.” Theodora grinned, “I could take the weapons back.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“This seems like extortion,” I complained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It is, and you have very little say in it,” Dr. Underhill grumbled. “Fine, take the boy for the day.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora looked to me hungrily. “Oh, I will.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think I’d rather be suffering at my firing station at this point.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora took me by the shoulder and led me out of the firing range.  Once we were out of earshot, she gave a concerned glance to me. “Are you okay?  Your superior officer doesn’t seem to care for your well being.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I grumbled, “He’s a demon.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora stifled a laugh. “I have a friend of mine who would love to kill him if it were true.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This caught my attention. “You have a demon-slaying friend?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods to me, “Oh yes.  How’s this: you meet me in two hours outside the base and I can tell you all about her and myself.” She gave me another predatory grin.  “I realize I didn’t catch your full name, Private.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Private Elon Winter,” I responded.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora’s eyebrow rose. “Winter… where have I heard that name before?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shrugged, “I guess I’ll see you later,” I made my way back to my quarters.  If I would be wandering about with a foreign dignitary, I should be in my uniform.  She was in hers after all. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two hours later I was walking out front when a limo pulled up with a strange flag I’d never seen before over it.  It was a white flag with a blue eye over it and some kind of golden belt under that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was in my full uniform and with the limo, it at least seemed appropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora climbed out of the limo awkwardly and adjusted her breastplate, smiling at me, “Very fetching. ” She grinned at me.  “We have a lot to discuss.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I climbed into the limo and settled inside. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora did the same, the limo shifting from her weight as she climbed in.  She sat down, her legs extended out in front of her rather than bent, mostly because of her size and the height of the limo.  “Drawbacks of being taller than the average population,” she explained, as she leaned over to me. “Shame it’s not a Saturday.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why?” I asked her, worrying where this conversation was heading.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“On Saturday, I love to watch MMA fights.  Whenever I’m around here, I try to plan it for fight night,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to this place before and I had a sense of where this was going.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your father was Barry ‘The Beast’ Winter, wasn’t he?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heaved a sigh.  “Yes,” I admitted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora was full of energy. “I knew it!  Oh, your father was amazing in his prime!” she gushed.  “Though, I really need to ask, wouldn’t Barry ‘The Blizzard’ Winter have worked better?  I mean… ‘The Best’ is still an awesome title but, the ‘Blizzard’ thing would have worked better,  right?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’d rather not discuss my father,” I said flatly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora seemed taken back. “Oh?  Why is that?  I know he’s retired, but I always thought his contract buy-out was unjust… merely for killing someone in the ring.  A part of the rhetoric is to protect oneself at all times.  It was unfair what happened to him, considering the circumstances.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Again, I don’t enjoy discussing my late father, please,” I begged.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora appeared shocked. “He passed?  I’m sorry!  I hadn’t heard.  I thought I would have.”  She frowned. “I won’t bring it up again, I promise.  I’m so sorry.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned. “Wait, you didn’t know he died?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I thought it would be in the news but I must have missed it.   I didn’t, I swear.” She placed her hand on my shoulder. “You must miss him.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He’s with God now,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An audible whimper from somewhere nearby, not from Theodora, echoed through the air and a chill ran down my spine.  I wriggled my finger into my ear to clear it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, this is beginning on a downer note,” Theodora explained.  “Still… I’m sure you’re in the mood for something to eat?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m an eighteen-year-old soldier.  Don’t expect me to be buying if it’s a meal to match the limo.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora chuckled. “I’m the one taking you out.” She sighed. “The culture here is so backward.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora’s breastplate armor, her size, and her flag finally got to me, and as much as I feared she would take the question as an interest in her, my curiosity was getting the better of me.  “What culture are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m unsurprised you’re unaware of it.”  She sighed.  “From Greece to Persia, my people were once feared and mighty.  History, of course, doesn’t enjoy hearing of the shield maidens of Greece or the horseback archers of Persia.  The idea was unsettling to many men.  That their wives could somehow take up arms against them and so forth,” she scoffed. “Could you imagine if the women of Iran knew of their proud heritage?”  She shook her head.  “Regardless of that heritage, I hail from a small city-state known as Penthesil, currently in Central America, right between Panama and Columbia.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“City-state?” I ask, perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, a grand city too.” She smiled. “Inspired by Rome, the city is large, sprawling, and most importantly guarded.  It’s very different from here, everything is firm concrete vs wood and cardboard.” She sighed. “Granted, the walls are constrictive.  Decades ago we had to move the farms out to build new housing.  The men seem pleased enough at that though.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sounds interesting.  I’d love to see it,” I lied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no you never can or will,” she explained. “Pentasil has, despite whining from the farmers and livestock owners on the outside, a strict tradition of barring men from within their walls.”   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They only fill the city with women?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods. “Yes.  Gives us time to govern without having to listen to the simpering of the opposite sex.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How progressive,  I said, “Where do the men live?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Outside of the walls, there are farms and villages the men live in.  There they are perfectly free and live happy lives,” she explained, “At least they should be.  There’s always someone whining.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re… you said a steward?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She nods. “I am the heir to the stewardship, second only to the queen’s line, which is a part of the great Queen Penthesilea’s lineage.  My mother traces her own heritage back to Persian Amazons of old.  While not technically royalty, her family proved beyond any doubt to be as capable, if not more so, than any other Valkyrie.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re kind of mixing things on me,” I said, confused. “I thought Amazons were Greek, and that Valkyrie was like… well, Vikings and stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods    “Yes.  In the same way, America is an allegation of multiple cultures, so are my people.  Our story began at the end of the battle of Troy.  After the tragic death of Queen Penthesilea, her niece Oterå, daughter of Hippolyta, gathered up the Greek tribes, and made alliances with the Persian warriors, and set forth to begin anew.  With Oterå being the last of a royal line, and the army suffering a tragic defeat at Troy, they had great difficulty making a living in the Mediterranian.” She stretched her legs, “While our tribe moved about, leaving our homeland as marauding armies took hold, we dwindled in number, but never vanished.  That was when our great Queen Melainppe the eighth, had a vision from the gods.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“A vision?  When was this?” I asked, never having heard any of it and wondering how much was fairytales and what was real. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“10th centuries, if I remember,” Theodora clarified. “But the vision promised life in a new land.” She chuckled. “They lost half the ships that set sail at sea, but the few that remained landed in what we think is modern-day Carolina.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There are two of those.” I corrected, “North and South.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, we aren’t too sure which, the records aren’t perfect and the description of the coast was… iffy, let&amp;#39;s say.” Theodora smiled at me, “By then they barely considered us Amazons, or as the native’s of the land referred to us ‘the Great Eagle Women’.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Still doesn’t explain the Valkyrie thing.” I pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods.  “At the time we were trying to eke out a living in the new land — it was fairly harsh, and we had no true place.  We had found plenty of iron ore nearby to help us make weapons, but the farming was subpar… likely because we lost our farmers to the sea.  We did, however, establish decent relations with the natives.  They had a large demand for our arrowheads and spearheads: so we had no issue smithing these to barter for food.” She grinned. “The raiding parties arrived, and changed everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Raiding parties?” I asked, confused.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Great warriors from the north had landed on the coast.  Brutal men, some called them giants, and word reached us through our native trade partners of farmland being razed, villages being destroyed, and most heinous, women being raped by the invaders.” She grinned, “And Queen Melainppe’s youngest daughter, Antiope, would have none of that.  She marched the troops to meet the raiding Viking parties, and defeated them in the field, but barely.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Doesn’t sound like a supreme victory,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Far from it, the warriors we had barely survived, and only did so because of a home field advantage, and support from the native peoples.” she smiled, “Princess Antiope was beside herself with rage!  Princess Antiope was beside herself that these men, fresh off of a boat, could come so close to defeating her despite her superior tactics, weapons, and numbers.  She established our oldest and most sacred tradition.” she leered at me, “Care to guess what it is?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m… completely unsure.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora rolled her eyes, “Princess Antiope came upon one of the injured Vikings and set herself to rape the man for hours.  She commanded her best warriors to do the same, taking the prisoners of war, and forcing themselves on them for days.  Princess Antiope said she would take the spoils of war, by ensuring they took the physical strength of our attackers for our future generations.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So… Princess Antiope, who was mad about hearing about women being raped, raped the Vikings?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Justice, as she had put it.  That led to the War of Generations.” She smiled proudly. “For five generations, it became a tradition for warrior women to travel up the coast, as a rite of passage, and sack a Viking encampment.  They chose only the strongest warriors to go, and only the strongest Vikings were chosen by the warriors.  Our losses dwindled each generation, as we grew stronger and more discerning about who was sent and who returned with what.  By the end, the Vikings left, declaring the Americas ‘the land of the Valkyrie’.  After so long there were no new Vikings coming, and as such, we continued the tradition every four years, using the sons they bore as our new raids.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I am clarifying that you… raped men for their seed, for five generations?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nodded, “We did it for over five generations.  Our hunt for warriors led us down south, until finally upon finding no new conquests, we settled in present-day Penthesil.  We built the city with the express purpose of not allowing men.” She chuckled. “Our joke was that the men kept giving us such poor directions that we declared that we would remain where we were that day and that we cast them out.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“And the raping continued?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora laughed. “Oh calm down… the men’s liberation movement started up in the 1950s — Championed by Queen Takisha.  While we used to raid the nearby villages, now the act is entirely ceremonial.  The men choose their own volunteers who take part, our strongest warriors are still chosen, and they mock battle in what is basically matchmaking.” She frowned. “Now, of course, the men want consent… takes the fun out of it in my opinion.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… all that consensual sex sure puts a damper on things…” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re biased, of course.” She grinned. “Besides, I’d need consent from you.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Limo came to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thus the dinner,” she explained, opening the door for me, “after you.” She pulled her legs up against herself to allow me to exit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I missed playing near death at the firing range, heck I longed for it.  I got out of the Limo and was surprised to see we were at a small Mexican restaurant.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hope you like spicy food,” Theodora said as she stepped out of the Limo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At the restaurant, I had got a little more information from Theodora, mostly about her demon slaying friend. “Your friend… the demon slayer… can you tell me about her?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora rolled her eyes, her elbows on the table, head resting on her hands. “You’re full of questions, aren’t you?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever can keep this conversation off of me…&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ugh… It’s an in-joke between us.  She’s obsessed with this anime about this guy with a ridiculous sword who runs around slicing demons in half and decapitating people.  The sword is ridiculous too, no human could ever hold this thing and yet the guy swings around what has to be a two-hundred-kilogram sword like its nothing — with one hand, no less!” she laughed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have no clue how heavy two hundred kilograms is,” I said. “But I assume that’s heavy.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re barely half that, I bet.” She grinned.  “I could pick you up and take a guess at your weight tho.” She flexed her arm, showing an impressive bulge under her uniform. “I’ve got a good handle on how much I can lift.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I try to guide the topic back to the original question. “So, heavy enough to be impossible to use.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods. “Yes, though if anyone could swing something like it with any real effect, it would be Zepherina.  She’s the strongest person on this planet.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You mean, the strongest woman?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora shook her head. “No, Zepherina is the strongest person on this earth.  I’ve seen her do things that strong men struggle to do, and they’re record-breaking.  She has strong genes, being the second princess and all, but still.” She gets a dreamy look in her eyes, “She’s incredible.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My escape was all but guaranteed. “So… you have a thing for her.  Are you, bi?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora sighed. “Americans… you treat sexuality like it has a definition.” She looked to me “Men are for one thing: Procreation.  That’s pretty much my only desire with you, no offense.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just telling me kills it for you though, doesn’t it?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh please… I blew it in the limo when I mentioned your father.” She smiles. “I’ve been entertaining you to make up for my blatant disregard for your feelings, and for the respect of your family.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So no Snu Snu then?” I grin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No ‘Snu Snu,” she chuckles.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But the princess, you like her?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I do, I long for the most perfect date: me and her, at the end of a victorious battle, embracing in celebration… then kissing deeply and spending the evening reveling in each other’s bodies.” Her face is flushed now, and she looks down, dejected, “except she says she has no interest in me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ouch.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… I don’t think she realized how much it hurt.  She’s still my closest friend, and I hold out hope that her mind will change.  But at the same time, I think I know how she feels.  It’s a one-way thing… for now, anyway.  Zepherina seems to want nothing more than to fight, I don’t think romance is on her mind in the slightest.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sounds like a heck of a warrior princess,” I said, taking a drink. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Zepherina, honestly, should rule.  She’s second in line to Queen Rachel’s throne… Evangeline is the first and, in all honesty, has no qualities to rule or bear children suitable for the throne.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why is that?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She’s a pipsqueak for one, shorter than you, and arrogant.  A real Napoléon complex… and she’s just like her mother, which is… bad.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t approve of the current queen?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora looks to me, around us, and back again, “No, few do.  She’s a monster.  Paranoid of her power, and of those who may want to overthrow her.  She has decreed that any challenge for her throne is to bet to the death, and she’s never too graceful to the loser.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What happens to the loser?” I questioned, worried.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The last one who challenged her suffered a defeat in a record time of only thirty seconds. Queen Rachel tore her arm clean off.”  Theodora shuddered. “Queen Rachel was furious that someone so weak believed they could rule that she ordered her other limbs surgically removed, and her, still living, thrown into a lake and left for dead.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit.  Please tell me that’s like… ancient times or something.” I shivered at the thought of being limbless, floating in the water, trying not to drown, or maybe hoping that you did.  Can you swim without your arms and legs?  What would happen if you reached the shore?  What then?  If the lake is in the middle of nowhere how do you manage? Just writhe about until you can find shelter?  Food?  How long could you last as a quadriplegic if they abandoned you? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That was about five years ago.” She frowned.“I’m just saying this because of how far I am from home, and from Queen Rachel’s reach.   Even the challenger&amp;#39;s family fled after the defeat, exiling themselves willingly for fear of what Rachel would have done to them.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So… you want Zepherina to be queen because she’s different?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora nods.  “Zepherina reminds many of her Grandmother, Queen Takisha.  Queen Takisha was just and wise, and though she vanished for what seemed like decades, she returned wise and learned… but carrying with her a child, and that child was Queen Rachel.” She stretched as she took a long drink from her bottle of beer.  “It’s said Rachel went on a similar quest as Queen Takisha did, but she came back bitter, vicious, and with a little girl, Evangeline, and carrying Zepherina.  No one knows where the father came from, as none of the villagers ever saw Queen Rachel—so where Evangeline and Zepherina get their lineage is completely unknown.  Hell, the only reason everyone knows Eva is Rachel’s is because of her wi-” Theodora interrupted herself, “will… her strong will.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There seems to be some conspiracy there.  Does it really matter who the father is?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora smiles at me. “It’s said there are two: Some say Evangeline is the daughter of the Devil and Rachel, that they made a dark pact.   While Zepherina is the daughter of Athena, who gave Rachel an immaculate birth.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is this Princess Evangeline that bad?  I mean… outside of her arrogance?  It can be tough being the short kid in school: you gotta pick fights to stay ahead of the pack and get respect.” I kind of felt for Evangeline.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Theodora was taken aback, “I’ve heard no one defend her outside of Zepherina, and I just assumed that was a sisterhood thing.” She shook her head.  “But you’ve never met her.  You’d see it in her eyes, she has the same eyes as her mother.  Those same cold ice-blue eyes.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thanks for the break,” I said as Theodora returned me to the base.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Anytime… I may swing by to see you again if I’m in the neighborhood.” She grin., “Maybe I’ll have better luck next time.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t count on it!” I said, waving as she drove off. As I walked back to the base, I saw General Drake inside, and to my shock, standing next to him was Demond, looking far meaner than I had ever seen him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The man of the hour,” General Drake said as he noticed me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“About fuckin’ time,” Demond almost growled.  I noticed his eyes were now yellow.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Demond spoke shortly.   “We’re shipping out, the two of us.  Get your gear and let&amp;#39;s get killing.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lieutenant, watch your tone,” General Drake said, turning him &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Demond turned to General Drake and glared at him, his hair turning white and his gritted teeth lengthening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I even knew what was happening, General Drake had a gun pointed point blank into Demond’s chest.&lt;br/&gt;\\n “Lieutenant… I have no intention of becoming another victim of yours.” He pulled the hammer back on the pistol.  “Back down or Project Winter ends right now.”  He glanced at me. “For the both &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DevlinRiptide\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/\"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello, I’d like to start off by saying I’m writing this while hiding in a forest. Part two is coming soon, I just need time to write down everything that has happened. My phone will die soon so when, or IF I make it out of here I will write more soon. I would ask you to call the cops, but I’m 100% sure they would be useless. I don’t even know where I am. - [op](https://www.reddit.com/u/clovercakes_/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=enabled)\\n\\n\\n Where the hell do I even begin... I’ll just tell you guys what happened the night of June 17th, 2:47 am. I was watching a scary movie in bed at that time, and a jump scare happened, it scared the hell out of me but a second later the tv started glitching and a alert went off. I thought it was an amber alert at first. But it wasn’t. the screen was a really dark red, almost like blood. It has white lettering that said shit like, “go outside, don’t be afraid”, then it would switch to “REVERSE, GET THE FINAL PIECE”, and my personal favorite “open you doors, let us all come in. We’re healing”. I swear I heard sobbing behind the sounds of warped sirens. The tv went blank. I realized I was frozen and couldn’t move, no matter how hard I tried. I glanced back at the tv only to see my name, in bold letters, taking up all of the tv. Alright, this has to be some fucking prank my brother did. He knows how to connect his phone to my tv with Bluetooth, it has to be that. \\n\\n“Chris, this isn’t fucking funny! Stop messing with me I’m trying to watch a movie!” I yelled.\\n\\nNo answer. I tried to squirm around and leave my bed but I wouldn’t budge, like I was being controlled. I started to panic, but then I heard my name. The tv said my fucking name. It didn’t sound like my brother or mom or dad. It sounded like- nothing I’ve ever heard before. If a animal could speak and wail with a high pitched screamed at the same time, it would be that. I had enough. I quietly said “who are you?”\\n\\nThe tv replied in a weird layered voice, sounding breathless now, “Harper” (my name, if you need to know).How did it know me? DID it know me? I stopped asking myself questions when the “alert buzzing” got louder and louder until it sounded like a dog whistle but I was being affected by it. I wanted to cover my ears but I couldn’t. Just when I thought my ears were going to explode from the unbearable pitch, the unknown force paralyzing me was finally released. I quickly turned off the tv and went to go look out my window. I just had this urge to go look, like a trance. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, like a star-less space. “The street lights are usually on at this time” I thought to myself. I stared outside for a while, looking for any source of light. None. I couldn’t even see the moon. I jumped back when sirens came screaming through the neighborhood, waking my family up. I’m sure it woke the whole damn neighborhood up as well. I couldn’t see any police cars or ambulances near by, I didn’t see any light. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. Outside. My house. Me. It was in my mind. It didn’t sound normal either. You know those videos on YouTube that make the audio all creepy and deep and glitchy? Distorted and all that? That’s what it sounded like. Much more surreal though, that haunting sound will probably never leave my brain for as long I live. I heard screeching in the distance that didn’t sound human either, like the alert on the tv. It was as loud as the sirens, but I only heard it for 2 seconds. It reminded me of those skin walker stories, all the screeching stuff. Maybe it was the tornado warning practice... No, those only happen on Wednesdays- I think. Tell me if I’m wrong please redditors. As the sirens went off, the lamp lights were back on again and the sky was cleared. The moon shone again and I could see the stars, it was no longer pitch black. The cloud of darkness was finally gone. The dead silence was eerie. No crickets or crunching of branches, and my street is right in the middle of a forest. It was like, everything was dead. As the darkness cleared, I realized every house’s door was opened. i winced my eyes back at my faint view front door, flinching when I saw it open. I raced down stairs, turning all the lights on and slammed it shut. I locked it, and made sure every single window and door were too. But, how did it get open? I was going back up stairs when I saw my dad on the floor, with his arms and legs strewn on the floor like he was making a snow angel. \\n\\n“DAD!” I ran over to him, and pulled at his arm. \\n\\n“W- how did-“ He muttered as I tried to get him off the floor. \\n\\n“Did you open the door dad?”\\n\\n“I don’t even remember getting on the floor- what is that noise?”\\n\\n“It’s going around the neighborhood. Everyone’s door is open too, look-“ I stopped in my tracks while pointing to the window near the front door, as everyone was staring blankly at my house, me, if anything, just standing their. My body went cold and the hairs on my neck stood up. \\n\\n“What’s wrong h-“ my dad did the same. “What the hell?” My dad left to get my mom and brother. I’ve never seen anything like this before, only in movies. On the comedic side, it sorta looked like a low budget “Us” thinking about it. My dad called the cops, no answer. I tried every phone in the house, no answer. After a while the sirens stopped but i could still faintly hear the same distorted deep sound ringing in my ears.\\n\\n“Damn it” I yelped, slamming the useless smart phone on the table. I felt so helpless and frustrated, I just wanted to go to bed. My family covered up all the windows. We all slept on the couch together, my dad having his shotgun by his side. The next morning, everyone was gone. I looked around in a hurry, only to see them in the kitchen, having breakfast, happily as can be. I asked them all “is everything okay?”. My only response was from my mom, who replied with “do you want pancakes, sweetie? Or maybe some eggs, you need some protein! Oh whatever, it’s summer, you can have both!You look so out of it! Sit down, sit down!” She said in a cheerful yet empty, blank and emotionless tone. It didn’t even sound like her. Her hair was done all nicely, she had makeup on with bright cherry red lipstick, and she was in a pink dress. My mom hates pink...\\n\\nI stood there in shock, thinking my mother has never spoke to me like that before. She usually greets me for a second and puts down cereal. It didn’t take me long to realize my entire family was dressed like a preppy rich family, at a country club or some shit. Even my BROTHER, a boy of no respect for suits and ties, or fancy clothing in general, was dressed in a light plaid buttoned shirt. He would never wear this. I turned to my dad (in a polo shirt. A POLO SHIRT.) and shakily asked “is everything all right?” \\n\\n“I have no idea what you mean.” He stated in a stern tone. “I’m fine. Your mothers fine. Your brothers fine, hopefully you are too. Now sit down, Please.”\\n\\nI sat down, more confused as ever, and ate. I looked down and was astonished at the fact I switched from a hoodie and sweatpants to a pastel blue corduroy skirt and a tucked in white, loose off the shoulder blouse. I know for a fact I do not own these clothes, I figured they were my moms. A million more thoughts rushed through my head. There was no explaining this. I swore I was in my comfy clothes just a second ago. How could I brush this off? I wanted to ask more questions but I was too afraid, for some reason. Not wanting to anger my so called “dad” again. It was the best breakfast I’ve ever had, being honest. That was the only part of the day I really enjoyed. I almost took a bite out of my pancakes when I looked down at a rotten hardened piece of strange looking meat covered with maggots. I dropped my silverware and staggered out of my seat, covering my mouth to keep my from vomiting from the stench. I looked around and everything was grey. All the color was gone. No more fancy table dinners with laced cloth. All the food was rotten. I gagged and almost ran into the bathroom when my mom randomly appeared in front of me and grabbed my arm tightly.\\n\\n\\n“Where are you going, honey bunch? Don’t you want to finish your breakfast?” She grinned and looked back at the table. So did I, seeing my dad and brother staring at me blankly. Her grip tightened, almost cutting off the circulation of my arm, still grinning at me while her eyes widening.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m so full mom! I want to go lay down. Is that okay with you?” I said, trying to act all preppy even though I was trembling like I had Parkinson’s disease.\\n\\nMy mom, with her head tilted and a grin that was almost touching her checks stared at me twitching her right eye for about 5 seconds before releasing me.\\n\\n“Sure, my little peach pie! Anything for you my dear!” She booped my nose with her finger and went back to the table. I blinked again and the color was back. The food was fine, the porcelain plates, the fancy laced table cloth, the light yellow roses in a vase, everything. I walked to my room, not being able to recognize anything. My “home” looked like a mansion. This wasn’t my home. And those people down stairs were NOT my family. I finally stumbled to my room, getting lost in the maze of halls. I looked out my window. It was unusually bright outside, the clouds looked fake, too perfect. The grass was a unreal shade of green with yellow and white flowers sprouted all around the street. All of our houses are the same, too. The same design, shape. But different pastel colors. I cried for about 20 minutes when I grabbed my phone and texted my next door neighbor, Annie. I don’t know her but maybe the same things happening to her? I copied our text chain, here’s the conversation.\\n\\n\\nAnnie? Hey, it’s Harper. Do you remember what happened last night?\\n\\n\\nHarper, can you come to my house. Something really strange is going on. I’m scared.\\n\\n\\nMe too Annie, but I can’t leave. My parents and brother are\\n\\n\\n(I saw “Annie” staring at me, waving and smiling out of my window. Sometimes we do see each other though our windows but she doesn’t say hi.)\\n\\n\\nHarper?\\n\\n\\nAnnie, why are you smiling at me like that?\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell do you mean\\n\\n\\nThrough your window, Annie. I can see you.\\n\\n\\n(No answer for about 5 min) \\n\\n\\nHarper, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. No ones at my window. But I can see you, waving and smiling at me, what the fuck? What’s happening? Why is everything the same? \\n\\n\\nI don’t know Annie. I don’t know. \\n\\n\\nDo you think we’re not in the same place?\\n\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n\\nLike, each of of, every single person in the neighborhood is in their own little fucked up fancy world. Harper, I tried leaving. I said I was going for a bike ride. I biked to the exit of the neighborhood and there’s gates. I asked the nearest house for the code and they didn’t answer. They just fucking smiled at me and slammed the door in my face. Something tells me I shouldn’t try to escape. I feel like people are watching me.\\n\\n\\nWhat? We don’t have gates. So your saying I’m alone and no one here is them? \\n\\n\\nI guess. I don’t want to believe it either. \\n\\n\\nWhat is their to believe.\\n\\n\\nI gotta go, my sister just called me down to play croquet. She doesn’t know how to do that, I don’t either. We don’t even have a croquet set.\\n\\n\\nJust act like them Annie, and I think you’ll be fine.\\n\\n\\n-End-\\n\\n\\nShe didn’t answer, hopefully she’s okay- shit. I think I hear my brother coming up the stairs.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I’d like to start off by saying I’m writing this while hiding in a forest. Part two is coming soon, I just need time to write down everything that has happened. My phone will die soon so when, or IF I make it out of here I will write more soon. I would ask you to call the cops, but I’m 100% sure they would be useless. I don’t even know where I am. - &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/clovercakes_/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;utm_term=enabled\"&gt;op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Where the hell do I even begin... I’ll just tell you guys what happened the night of June 17th, 2:47 am. I was watching a scary movie in bed at that time, and a jump scare happened, it scared the hell out of me but a second later the tv started glitching and a alert went off. I thought it was an amber alert at first. But it wasn’t. the screen was a really dark red, almost like blood. It has white lettering that said shit like, “go outside, don’t be afraid”, then it would switch to “REVERSE, GET THE FINAL PIECE”, and my personal favorite “open you doors, let us all come in. We’re healing”. I swear I heard sobbing behind the sounds of warped sirens. The tv went blank. I realized I was frozen and couldn’t move, no matter how hard I tried. I glanced back at the tv only to see my name, in bold letters, taking up all of the tv. Alright, this has to be some fucking prank my brother did. He knows how to connect his phone to my tv with Bluetooth, it has to be that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chris, this isn’t fucking funny! Stop messing with me I’m trying to watch a movie!” I yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No answer. I tried to squirm around and leave my bed but I wouldn’t budge, like I was being controlled. I started to panic, but then I heard my name. The tv said my fucking name. It didn’t sound like my brother or mom or dad. It sounded like- nothing I’ve ever heard before. If a animal could speak and wail with a high pitched screamed at the same time, it would be that. I had enough. I quietly said “who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The tv replied in a weird layered voice, sounding breathless now, “Harper” (my name, if you need to know).How did it know me? DID it know me? I stopped asking myself questions when the “alert buzzing” got louder and louder until it sounded like a dog whistle but I was being affected by it. I wanted to cover my ears but I couldn’t. Just when I thought my ears were going to explode from the unbearable pitch, the unknown force paralyzing me was finally released. I quickly turned off the tv and went to go look out my window. I just had this urge to go look, like a trance. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, like a star-less space. “The street lights are usually on at this time” I thought to myself. I stared outside for a while, looking for any source of light. None. I couldn’t even see the moon. I jumped back when sirens came screaming through the neighborhood, waking my family up. I’m sure it woke the whole damn neighborhood up as well. I couldn’t see any police cars or ambulances near by, I didn’t see any light. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. Outside. My house. Me. It was in my mind. It didn’t sound normal either. You know those videos on YouTube that make the audio all creepy and deep and glitchy? Distorted and all that? That’s what it sounded like. Much more surreal though, that haunting sound will probably never leave my brain for as long I live. I heard screeching in the distance that didn’t sound human either, like the alert on the tv. It was as loud as the sirens, but I only heard it for 2 seconds. It reminded me of those skin walker stories, all the screeching stuff. Maybe it was the tornado warning practice... No, those only happen on Wednesdays- I think. Tell me if I’m wrong please redditors. As the sirens went off, the lamp lights were back on again and the sky was cleared. The moon shone again and I could see the stars, it was no longer pitch black. The cloud of darkness was finally gone. The dead silence was eerie. No crickets or crunching of branches, and my street is right in the middle of a forest. It was like, everything was dead. As the darkness cleared, I realized every house’s door was opened. i winced my eyes back at my faint view front door, flinching when I saw it open. I raced down stairs, turning all the lights on and slammed it shut. I locked it, and made sure every single window and door were too. But, how did it get open? I was going back up stairs when I saw my dad on the floor, with his arms and legs strewn on the floor like he was making a snow angel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“DAD!” I ran over to him, and pulled at his arm. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“W- how did-“ He muttered as I tried to get him off the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Did you open the door dad?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t even remember getting on the floor- what is that noise?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s going around the neighborhood.

I’ve never seen anything like this before, only in movies. On the comedic side, it sorta looked like a low budget “Us” thinking about it. My dad called the cops, no answer. I tried every phone in the house, no answer. After a while the sirens stopped but i could still faintly hear the same distorted deep sound ringing in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Damn it” I yelped, slamming the useless smart phone on the table.

My only response was from my mom, who replied with “do you want pancakes, sweetie? Or maybe some eggs, you need some protein! Oh whatever, it’s summer, you can have both!You look so out of it! Sit down, sit down!” She said in a cheerful yet empty, blank and emotionless tone. It didn’t even sound like her. Her hair was done all nicely, she had makeup on with bright cherry red lipstick, and she was in a pink dress. My mom hates pink...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stood there in shock, thinking my mother has never spoke to me like that before. She usually greets me for a second and puts down cereal. It didn’t take me long to realize my entire family was dressed like a preppy rich family, at a country club or some shit. Even my BROTHER, a boy of no respect for suits and ties, or fancy clothing in general, was dressed in a light plaid buttoned shirt. He would never wear this. I turned to my dad (in a polo shirt. A POLO SHIRT.) and shakily asked “is everything all right?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea what you mean.” He stated in a stern tone. “I’m fine. Your mothers fine. Your brothers fine, hopefully you are too. Now sit down, Please.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sat down, more confused as ever, and ate.

It was the best breakfast I’ve ever had, being honest. That was the only part of the day I really enjoyed. I almost took a bite out of my pancakes when I looked down at a rotten hardened piece of strange looking meat covered with maggots. I dropped my silverware and staggered out of my seat, covering my mouth to keep my from vomiting from the stench. I looked around and everything was grey. All the color was gone. No more fancy table dinners with laced cloth. All the food was rotten. I gagged and almost ran into the bathroom when my mom randomly appeared in front of me and grabbed my arm tightly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where are you going, honey bunch? Don’t you want to finish your breakfast?” She grinned and looked back at the table. So did I, seeing my dad and brother staring at me blankly. Her grip tightened, almost cutting off the circulation of my arm, still grinning at me while her eyes widening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I’m so full mom! I want to go lay down. Is that okay with you?” I said, trying to act all preppy even though I was trembling like I had Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mom, with her head tilted and a grin that was almost touching her checks stared at me twitching her right eye for about 5 seconds before releasing me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure, my little peach pie!

       "   'selftext': \" \\n\\nI live in Detroit, so seeing drug deals or women selling their bodies isn’t uncommon in certain parts of town.\\n\\nIt’s hard to explain to people that aren’t from around here, exactly what living here is like. \\n\\nThe thing about the city is that true danger depends on where you are and what time it is. Daytime is usually OK. Nighttime, however, is better spent indoors - for more than one reason.\\n\\nI work as a restoration craftsman through a company my friends family owns. Without getting into too much detail, my job has me working out of downtown, which means I don’t have to travel far to get to the site. We’re doing restorative work on an old church that used to be beautiful. Nowadays, it’s a relic with a less than inviting atmosphere.\\n\\nThe job has been an ongoing project for a little over a year now and, as creepy as the building is, I’d never seen anything to warrant fear during my long days working in the chapel.\\n\\nThe building is in a less than desirable part of town, which means that, during my long walk from the nearby parking structure to the church, I end up chatting with some of the prostitutes that work the street just outside.\\n\\nI'm not on a first name basis with them, but I’ve made them laugh a couple times and, instead of hitting me up for work when I approach, they smile and wave.\\n\\nDuring my last couple months on site, I started noticing that they were acting a bit different. They seemed quiet and intimidated for one reason or another. Unfortunately, since this is the east side of Detroit, I chalked it up to pressure from pimp’s and/or local gangs in the area. As it happens, I was quite wrong. When I finally convinced one of them to talk to me, I was surprised by what she had to say.\\n\\n“Somethin ain’t right out here,” she said.\\n\\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\\n\\n“Girl’s disappearin’.. I don’t know. Pimps don’t like not havin’ answers when they property up and vanishes.. And..”\\n\\nShe was clearly hesitating as she scratched at some scars on her arm.\\n\\n“People seein’ things. It can’t be what I’ve heard em say it is.”\\n\\n“What do they say?” I asked curiously.\\n\\n“Some kind of..demon. My sista said she saw it walkin’ down the street, like it was some kinda man. When one of her girls approached him, it..”\\n\\nI waited for her to finish but it became obvious talking about it was making her too uneasy.\\n\\n“I gotta get back to work,” she concluded.\\n\\nThe conversation left me very confused and mildly creeped out. What had they *actually* scene, I wondered, and what happened to the girl who her sister had seen attacked?\\n\\nThe girls continued to become more nervous and their numbers dwindled over the span of a few days.\\n\\nI considered telling the police, but that’s the other thing about Detroit. The police are spread so thin that contacting them won’t result in an immediate response. Especially if your call is in regard to prostitutes going missing.\\n\\nSo, ultimately, there was nothing I could do. And I still tell myself that.. after what happened.\\n\\nI remember that day being extremely long. My bosses asked if I was willing to work a little later each night to help expedite some of the repairs. I agreed.\\n\\nI worked until almost 11:00 PM that night. I had a goal of completing the sand work I was doing on some of the pews before I left. When I saw the time I decided to take a smoke break.\\n\\nIt was summer but there was a chill in the air still. I liked to sit outside and look at the buildings while listening to the noise of cars in the distance. It helped relax me before getting back to work.\\n\\nAs I listened that night, I began to realize the city sounded different. For some reason, everything was quiet. Even the breeze brought with it no sound.\\n\\nUntil the scream. The first scream, that is.\\n\\nI took the cigarette out of my mouth and stood up, looking in the direction of the noise from further down the road. A woman was running down the sidewalk, without shoes on. She looked behind herself a couple of times before hopping a fence and cutting across someone’s property.\\n\\nWeird, I thought. Across the street from me, I could see the usual girls who hung out around the job site. They all looked scared, staring up the road blankly as if waiting for the sun to rise. I looked repeatedly from the end of the road back to them.\\n\\nA buzz came from my pocket and I pulled out my phone. My friend asked when I was going to be home from work, he needed my help in a game and wasn’t going to leave me alone until I got online.\\n\\nI looked down the street one last time, thinking I would see something, anything at all. When I didn’t, I put my cigarette out and went inside to finish up.\\n\\nI was almost done. My electric sander was whirring loudly as I ran it down the final leg of the seating. I thought my ears were tricking me at first, until I powered off the sander and listened again. Several screams sounded from out front of the church.\\n\\nA couple moments after, I could hear the doors swinging open and the sounds of terrified women filtering into the building. I stood up and watched as a few of the women ran past the pews and toward the wall behind me, whimpering and begging for help.\\n\\n“What's going on?” I yelled in a panic.\\n\\n“It’s..It’s..” The poor woman nearest me couldn’t get her words out.\\n\\nBefore she could try to gather herself, the sound of gagging came from the front of the building. I turned again to see something I will never forget.\\n\\nA woman was floating in the air, suspended by her neck with her body dangling limp. It slowly moved forward just before being tossed in our direction.\\n\\nThe three women behind me screamed as her body landed with a thud.\\n\\n“What is it?” I yelled.\\n\\nThe women were breathing heavily while shifting along the wall, trying to find out how they could escape.\\n\\n“It’s..” the same woman from before attempted to speak again. “It’s a man..with the face of a monster.”\\n\\nI looked at her, unsure of what to believe.\\n\\n“Where is it?” I asked. The room where the body had been levitating was empty now, and I didn’t know where to look.\\n\\n“It’s there - right there!” The woman screamed while gesturing angrily.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. I saw nothing in the aisle and had no way to try and defend the terrified women, cowering behind me.\\n\\nSuddenly, the pews I stood between clapped together on my legs. I screamed as I tried to shake free. My left leg was searing with pain, I knew right away it was broken.\\n\\nThe pain distracted me from the women who had started to scatter. The last woman to try and escape had been caught. I looked up in time to see the invisible grip tighten around her forearm.\\n\\n“No, no, no,” she cried with a whimper, as if she was a little girl again. \\n\\nI watched helplessly as her arm bent in a way no arm is meant to. Her scream echoed powerfully throughout the building, but was cut short as something tore though her throat and down to her chest. Blood poured onto the floor in a thick pool. Her body lingered for a moment before dropping lifelessly to the ground.\\n\\nI was sweating profusely as I shifted all my weight onto my unbroken leg. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t talk. I only watched as a human shaped footprint appeared with each slowly paced step through the dead prostitutes blood. The bloody prints continued around me and back out of the building, into the streets from where it came.\\n\\nI don’t know what. I don’t know why.\\n\\nSome unseen force seems to be trying to purify the streets, but why? The more I dig into what happened, the more questions I'm left with.\\n\\nI still work for the company but I switched projects. My bosses were understanding after that night.\\n\\nI feel horrible for those poor women. What little I learned about them during our friendly interactions, pointed toward them being decent people on hard times.\\n\\nI don’t know what’s happening in my city, but the prostitutes of [Detroit](https://fb.me/ryrywrites) aren’t safe.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Have you ever wondered why we keep our eyes shut during prayer? Ever since I was little I’ve wondered this. I mean what is so important that we can’t even look at it? For some backstory, I live in a rural town with less than 250 residents. We were all very close, especially if you knew each other from church, which was mainly the case, it’s a very religious town. \\n\\nI grew up saying a prayer before every meal, and it wasn’t until I was 6 that I started to question why we couldn’t open our eyes, and there probably is something about it in the Bible, but truth be told, I’ve never actually finished the Bible, nor did I pay attention while reading it. For years I asked my parents, but the only answer I ever got was “we’re not allowed to see God listen to our prayers”, and that never answered my question. I mean, why couldn’t we see God? Isn’t that how people believe things? To see is to believe, right?\\n\\nWhen I turned 14, I decided I’d heard enough. Seriously, what was so bad about opening your eyes? If my parents wouldn’t give me the answer, then there’s only one other way. My siblings got the table set, while my father and I finished cooking the food. We dished out the meal, and we all sat down waiting for my mother to finish her shower. Once she sat down my father put his hands together, then the rest of us soon did the same, we all closed our eyes as he began, “Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for . . .” it was either now or never. I slowly opened my eyes to see my family praying, I was really disappointed, but at the same time, I don’t know what else I expected. My father wasn’t even halfway finished with the prayer when I heard something, the rest of my family had no reaction, so I brushed it off as nothing. Once more, I heard the sound, but this time closer, I turned around to face the kitchen. Standing there I saw a man, if you could even call it that, his face was thin, but at the same time bloodied and swollen, he had a thick thorn crown stabbing him, letting blood rush down his face, he had skin chunks hanging on by a thread, lacerations covered his slender body, there were holes in his hand and feet. His heavy breathing drowned out the sound of my father, we made eye contact, I was paralyzed with fear, he walked closer and the stench of rotting flesh surrounded me. He was maybe a few feet away from me when I heard my father say “Amen”, and the man was gone. \\n\\nMy mother’s voice broke me from my trance, “Are you alright, dear? What’s wrong?” I turned back around in my chair to be met with my father’s disapproving face, “Were you even praying with us?” I look at him, not even fully comprehending the question, “Well?”, his voice became more insisting, but it still seemed so distant. At this point, everyone was looking at me, it didn't really phase me, I just remained silent. “Alright, if you’re going to skip prayer, and ignore your parents you can go straight to your room.” I got up and did as my father said, I headed to my room and just sat there. Why? Why did I make such an asinine decision? How was I supposed to know what I’d see? What exactly did I even see? The image kept flashing in my head, and the disgusting odor that trailed the grotesque figure. I had to be seeing things, right? Some type of hallucination, I mean none of the rest of my family seemed to notice the being. Not too long later, my mother walked through the door.\\n\\n“Your father is very disappointed in you”, I couldn’t make eye contact with her, “I’m very disappointed in you as well”\\n\\n“Mom, I’m sorry it’s just-”\\n\\n“No excuses. I want you to apologise to your father in the morning, and tonight, I recommend you apologise to God as well”\\n\\nShe left the room before I could say anything. I sat there, alone in the dark, picturing the man that I saw, what ever he was. \\n\\nI didn’t sleep very well that night, I couldn’t get that image out of my head. At some point I ending up falling asleep, but only to be soon woken up by my door creaking open. I was facing the wall and too afraid to face the open area. The sound of footsteps slowly approached my bed made me close my eyes as tight as I could, the world felt like it was spinning, I told myself that I was dreaming as the footsteps got closer. But then, it stopped, I began to relax my muscles, then there was a drip on my cheek, I panicked, fight or flight kicked in, I quickly turned on my back to be met face to face with the butchered man; he was leaning over me, I froze, my stomach began to churn, he slowly reached his hand to me, I screamed at the top of my lungs, my brother came bursting through the door turning on the light, and once again, the man was gone. There was a ringing all around me, I couldn’t hear what my brother was saying to me, my body ached, I hadn’t realised I been crying until I felt drops fall on my hands. \\n\\nThe next day, my mother took me to the doctor, she did a quick check up and found nothing wrong, but she did end up giving me a prescription to help me sleep, then she sent us home. The car ride back was silent, when we got out of the car my mother refused to look me in the eyes. I walked into the house and headed straight into my room. I sat on the bed just thinking. *I have to be going mad, this isn’t normal, that’s not real, it’s just some figment of my imagination, it has to be.* I laid down on my bed, just staring off into nothingness. The texture of the ceiling put me in an odd trance, and I slowly drifted off into a deep sleep.\\n\\nI awoke to a dark room. I sat up, and just as I did so, I heard an odd cry, like an animal was in pain, the only thought that came to my mind was that it was my dog, worried, I went to go find her. Once I swung my legs to the side of the bed, I was met with a disgusting, hot, mushy mucus like substance on the wood floors. Startled, I bring my feet back up, I turn on my bedside lamp and look down, it was blood, and a lot of it, I look up once more, and that’s when I see him, standing in the corner of my room, right next to the door. I became faint, and the world seemed as if it were closing in, his piercing glance made me feel too weak to even move. The odor surrounded me as he got closer, I pushed myself as close to the wall as I could, and squeezed my eyes shut. *I’m dreaming, I have to be dreaming, this isn’t real, he’s not really here, it’s just a dream*. I opened my eyes and his face was only mere inches away from mine. The thought of it being a dream remained in my head, that was, until he put his hand over my heart, and burning sensation overwhelmed me. Once more, my screams echoed throughout the room, sending both of my parents bursting through the door, and the man just vanished. My parents ran over to me, and their worried faces were the last thing I saw before I blacked out.\\n\\nI woke up to my mother patting a damp washcloth on my forehead when she saw my eyes open. Her expression changed instantly and she gave me a hug, still confused I just laid there.\\n\\n“Thank the Heavens you’re alright, you gave us a real scare back there.” She smiled at me, which felt nice, seeing that she would look at me.\\n\\n“Now I know you just woke up, but your father and I want you to get some more rest. Here, take this,” she handed me a pill, which I assume is the one the doctor gave us to help me sleep. She gave me one last smile before quietly saying “goodnight”, and then she left. Once she closed the door, my heart began to burn again. I could tell that my body was extremely stressed. My head was hurting really badly, and once more, I got that strange feeling that happens right before *he* shows up. I sit up, and prop myself against the wall, my heart starts racing, which is accompanied by the burn getting more intense. I hear cracks and pops coming from under the bed, right after, *he* appeared. Nausea overtook me, the feeling wouldn’t go away, my whole body began to hurt. Suddenly, I lost all control of my body, and became completely paralized to the point where I couldn’t do or say anything. My body felt as if it were on fire, but I couldn’t see anything, just the man. His dull, sunken eyes just stared me down. He crawled onto the bed and my lungs began to give way, my breathing became fast, and painful coughs escaped my body as the feeling of being crushed joined the mixture. My body shook violently as I began to cough an alarming amount of blood. The man leaned in closer, everything hurts, and dread overtook me. The grotesque man leaned right into my ear and uttered out this one sentence to me,\\n\\n“You should have kept your eyes closed”\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why we keep our eyes shut during prayer? Ever since I was little I’ve wondered this. I mean what is so important that we can’t even look at it? For some backstory, I live in a rural town with less than 250 residents. We were all very close, especially if you knew each other from church, which was mainly the case, it’s a very religious town. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I grew up saying a prayer before every meal, and it wasn’t until I was 6 that I started to question why we couldn’t open our eyes, and there probably is something about it in the Bible, but truth be told, I’ve never actually finished the Bible, nor did I pay attention while reading it. For years I asked my parents, but the only answer I ever got was “we’re not allowed to see God listen to our prayers”, and that never answered my question. I mean, why couldn’t we see God? Isn’t that how people believe things? To see is to believe, right?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned 14, I decided I’d heard enough. Seriously, what was so bad about opening your eyes? If my parents wouldn’t give me the answer, then there’s only one other way. My siblings got the table set, while my father and I finished cooking the food. We dished out the meal, and we all sat down waiting for my mother to finish her shower. Once she sat down my father put his hands together, then the rest of us soon did the same, we all closed our eyes as he began, “Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for . . .” it was either now or never. I slowly opened my eyes to see my family praying, I was really disappointed, but at the same time, I don’t know what else I expected. My father wasn’t even halfway finished with the prayer when I heard something, the rest of my family had no reaction, so I brushed it off as nothing. Once more, I heard the sound, but this time closer, I turned around to face the kitchen. Standing there I saw a man, if you could even call it that, his face was thin, but at the same time bloodied and swollen, he had a thick thorn crown stabbing him, letting blood rush down his face, he had skin chunks hanging on by a thread, lacerations covered his slender body, there were holes in his hand and feet. His heavy breathing drowned out the sound of my father, we made eye contact, I was paralyzed with fear, he walked closer and the stench of rotting flesh surrounded me. He was maybe a few feet away from me when I heard my father say “Amen”, and the man was gone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother’s voice broke me from my trance, “Are you alright, dear? What’s wrong?” I turned back around in my chair to be met with my father’s disapproving face, “Were you even praying with us?” I look at him, not even fully comprehending the question, “Well?”, his voice became more insisting, but it still seemed so distant. At this point, everyone was looking at me, it didn&amp;#39;t really phase me, I just remained silent. “Alright, if you’re going to skip prayer, and ignore your parents you can go straight to your room.” I got up and did as my father said, I headed to my room and just sat there.

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nI\\'m nearly out of college now, about a week away from my graduation. My degree\\'s lasted me 4 years, and due to my fathers death two years ago I\\'ve paid for half out of my own pocket. Now, living in Detroit jobs are hard to come by. I was damn near dropping out to join the army just to be able to live before a buddy of mine recommended driving for Uber. \"I do it on weekends, you get an odd ball every now and again but it\\'s decent cash,\" he said to me after a lecture one day. I already owned an electric car, a old 2009 Toyota Prius, so fuel wouldn\\'t be a massive issue. Besides, I was and still am an extroverted person so I love meeting new people. So, I started driving.\\n\\nI enjoyed it, for the most part. What my buddy had said was not to far off the truth. But shit, I\\'d be lying if I said I\\'d recommended it, especially if you live in Detroit. There have been times where I\\'ve been so scared I\\'ve had to get new seats, let alone new pants. But, since I\\'m about to end my short career working fro Uber, I figured I\\'d compile all the... memorable moments I\\'ve had into a piece of writing. So uh, yeah. Here you are.\\\\\\\\\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**1.**\\n\\nI did a pick up once for a slightly older looking dude from a nightclub. He got into the backseat with a significantly younger woman, who seemed either really drunk or really high, I couldn\\'t quite tell but I could smell liquor and weed so really it could\\'ve been either, if not both. The guy on the other hand, seemed pretty sober. Naturally, this sent of massive alarm clocks in my head but I decided not to ask questions, and just drive them to where they wanted to go. Neither of them said anything for a while, and because it was so late at night I wasn\\'t really feeling a conversation either so I didn\\'t say much either. I kept looking back at this dude for a while though, something about him just wasn\\'t right. He was older than most my clients, around 40-45 with slicked back dark grey hair and brown eyes. No facial hair either, save a small tuft on his chin. The most notable part was his teeth. Whenever he smiled, which he was for most of the trip, I got a glimpse in the rear-view mirror. They were crooked to the point of looking jumbled, like they were just dropped into his mouth at any odd angle. Most of all, though, they were sharp. Like, seriously sharp. They looked like they came out of some sort of carnivore, not a human. \\n\\n This really gave me the creeps. The worst part was yet to come. When we finally arrived at his destination, it wasn\\'t a house. Well, it hadn\\'t been a house for years. I\\'m sure you have all seen the photos of abandoned houses on abandoned streets in Detroit, and this house looked just like that. Nevertheless, I pulled up to the curve. \"Are you sure this is the right address, sir?\" I asked, while checking my phone to make sure I had gotten it right. No response. \"Sir?\" I ask again, still looking down. No response. Finally, I look up into the mirror to see... nothing. No one was in the back seat, not the girl or the man. I checked, and the doors were still locked. I wouldn\\'t normally, but when driving around certain areas you need to lock the door. How the fuck would they have gotten out if the doors were still locked? Also, my hearing is in pretty good condition, I never even listen to loud music, so I would\\'ve heard them leave. Also looking outside the windows, I didn\\'t see anyone walking. It was a real job, I had been paid for the trip, so it\\'s not like I had imagined the thing somehow. To this day I have no idea.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2**\\n\\nIn Detroit, a lot of people go missing, adults and kids. It just so happens that I transported a man and who I thought was his son out into the middle of bumfuck nowhere, just for the dude to kill the kid and burnt the body. At least, that\\'s what the police told me after rounds upon rounds of questioning. You see, after I had finished that trip I called it a day and went to the local corner store on the way home to pickup some things, and lo and behold who do I see on my milk carton other than that same fucking kid. I called the police, and it went from there. They never found the guy, but have linked him to 3 other missing children in the area. This one still messes with me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3**\\n\\nHere\\'s one that more \\'what the fuck\\' than particular creepy. I picked up this guy once, from a small house a little ways out of downtown. He was tall, at least 6,4, and quite lanky too. I was in a good mood that day, so I tried to make a bit of conversation. I like talking with my passengers, as I said before I enjoy meeting new people. Anyway, this guy says almost nothing. Like, one word responses to every single question. Eventually, we get to his destination, another small house about 10 minutes drive from the pickup point. He gets out, says goodbye and everything seems normal. I drive off, and must\\'ve made it to around 30 mph when I hear a knock on the window. It\\'s the same guy, running. He motions to pull over, which I do. In a shock, I roll down the window to ask him whats up. \"Sorry, I left my phone in the back seat.\" No context to the fact he just ran faster than anyone ever. Initially, I thought my speed dial was fucked but I had it checked and it was fine.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**4**\\n\\nI always save the best (or in this case worst, depending on how you look at it) to last, so here\\'s the one that keeps me up at night. I pick up this woman just outside of downtown around midnight. She hops in and starts to berate me, asking me why I took so long. Taken aback, I apologise. She immediately starts to break down and cry, sobbing and just tells me to drive. The trips a long one, half an hour to the airport. Along the way she starts to talk several times, before just going back to crying. Eventually, she spits ti out. \"He\\'s coming after me.\" Thats all she said. I asked her if she needed me to call the police, but she said they wouldn\\'t do anything for her. \"He\\'s gonna take me away, with him,\" she blubbered out between quite sobs. She went on to say other things, but they were inaudible mumbles. The last thing she said before I had to drop her off was; \"The Nain Rouge, and he\\'s getting close.\" Yeah, that was all the motivation it took for me to get her out and for me to speed off, as fast as my shitty little Prius could go. \\n\\nThe Nain Rouge, for those of you who don\\'t know, is what I once believed to be anther bullshit fairy tale about a little demon that roams the streets of Detroit, causing all the bad things to happen for the city and dragging people back to wherever he came from. Not being a superstitious person, I never believed in it. Now I do. Why? Because when I checked the news later that day the woman I had picked up was found, dead. Not too strange, but definitely creepy that they found her body. The part that got me was the fact that police said she was dead for at least a month before they found her.\\n\\n \\n\\nI have a few more stories that I might tell tomorrow, but if your from Detroit or if you just have any info on the Nain Rouge I\\'d love to hear it, because the last sighting of it was back in 1976, but I know it\\'s still around.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearly out of college now, about a week away from my graduation. My degree&amp;#39;s lasted me 4 years, and due to my fathers death two years ago I&amp;#39;ve paid for half out of my own pocket. Now, living in Detroit jobs are hard to come by. I was damn near dropping out to join the army just to be able to live before a buddy of mine recommended driving for Uber. &amp;quot;I do it on weekends, you get an odd ball every now and again but it&amp;#39;s decent cash,&amp;quot; he said to me after a lecture one day. I already owned an electric car, a old 2009 Toyota Prius, so fuel wouldn&amp;#39;t be a massive issue. Besides, I was and still am an extroverted person so I love meeting new people. So, I started driving.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed it, for the most part. What my buddy had said was not to far off the truth. But shit, I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said I&amp;#39;d recommended it, especially if you live in Detroit. There have been times where I&amp;#39;ve been so scared I&amp;#39;ve had to get new seats, let alone new pants. But, since I&amp;#39;m about to end my short career working fro Uber, I figured I&amp;#39;d compile all the... memorable moments I&amp;#39;ve had into a piece of writing. So uh, yeah. Here you are.\\\\&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did a pick up once for a slightly older looking dude from a nightclub. He got into the backseat with a significantly younger woman, who seemed either really drunk or really high, I couldn&amp;#39;t quite tell but I could smell liquor and weed so really it could&amp;#39;ve been either, if not both. The guy on the other hand, seemed pretty sober. Naturally, this sent of massive alarm clocks in my head but I decided not to ask questions, and just drive them to where they wanted to go. Neither of them said anything for a while, and because it was so late at night I wasn&amp;#39;t really feeling a conversation either so I didn&amp;#39;t say much either. I kept looking back at this dude for a while though, something about him just wasn&amp;#39;t right. He was older than most my clients, around 40-45 with slicked back dark grey hair and brown eyes. No facial hair either, save a small tuft on his chin. The most notable part was his teeth. Whenever he smiled, which he was for most of the trip, I got a glimpse in the rear-view mirror. They were crooked to the point of looking jumbled, like they were just dropped into his mouth at any odd angle. Most of all, though, they were sharp. Like, seriously sharp. They looked like they came out of some sort of carnivore, not a human. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This really gave me the creeps. The worst part was yet to come. When we finally arrived at his destination, it wasn&amp;#39;t a house. Well, it hadn&amp;#39;t been a house for years. I&amp;#39;m sure you have all seen the photos of abandoned houses on abandoned streets in Detroit, and this house looked just like that. Nevertheless, I pulled up to the curve. &amp;quot;Are you sure this is the right address, sir?&amp;quot; I asked, while checking my phone to make sure I had gotten it right. No response. &amp;quot;Sir?&amp;quot; I ask again, still looking down. No response. Finally, I look up into the mirror to see... nothing. No one was in the back seat, not the girl or the man. I checked, and the doors were still locked. I wouldn&amp;#39;t normally, but when driving around certain areas you need to lock the door. How the fuck would they have gotten out if the doors were still locked? Also, my hearing is in pretty good condition, I never even listen to loud music, so I would&amp;#39;ve heard them leave. Also looking outside the windows, I didn&amp;#39;t see anyone walking. It was a real job, I had been paid for the trip, so it&amp;#39;s not like I had imagined the thing somehow. To this day I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In Detroit, a lot of people go missing, adults and kids. It just so happens that I transported a man and who I thought was his son out into the middle of bumfuck nowhere, just for the dude to kill the kid and burnt the body. At least, that&amp;#39;s what the police told me after rounds upon rounds of questioning. You see, after I had finished that trip I called it a day and went to the local corner store on the way home to pickup some things, and lo and behold who do I see on my milk carton other than that same fucking kid. I called the police, and it went from there. They never found the guy, but have linked him to 3 other missing children in the area. This one still messes with me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s one that more &amp;#39;what the fuck&amp;#39; than particular creepy. I picked up this guy once, from a small house a little ways out of downtown. He was tall, at least 6,4, and quite lanky too. I was in a good mood that day, so I tried to make a bit of conversation. I like talking with my passengers, as I said before I enjoy meeting new people. Anyway, this guy says almost nothing. Like, one word responses to every single question. Eventually, we get to his destination, another small house about 10 minutes drive from the pickup point. He gets out, says goodbye and everything seems normal. I drive off, and must&amp;#39;ve made it to around 30 mph when I hear a knock on the window. It&amp;#39;s the same guy, running. He motions to pull over, which I do. In a shock, I roll down the window to ask him whats up. &amp;quot;Sorry, I left my phone in the back seat.&amp;quot; No context to the fact he just ran faster than anyone ever. Initially, I thought my speed dial was fucked but I had it checked and it was fine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I always save the best (or in this case worst, depending on how you look at it) to last, so here&amp;#39;s the one that keeps me up at night. I pick up this woman just outside of downtown around midnight. She hops in and starts to berate me, asking me why I took so long. Taken aback, I apologise. She immediately starts to break down and cry, sobbing and just tells me to drive. The trips a long one, half an hour to the airport. Along the way she starts to talk several times, before just going back to crying. Eventually, she spits ti out. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s coming after me.&amp;quot; Thats all she said. I asked her if she needed me to call the police, but she said they wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything for her. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s gonna take me away, with him,&amp;quot; she blubbered out between quite sobs. She went on to say other things, but they were inaudible mumbles. The last thing she said before I had to drop her off was; &amp;quot;The Nain Rouge, and he&amp;#39;s getting close.&amp;quot; Yeah, that was all the motivation it took for me to get her out and for me to speed off, as fast as my shitty little Prius could go. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Nain Rouge, for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, is what I once believed to be anther bullshit fairy tale about a little demon that roams the streets of Detroit, causing all the bad things to happen for the city and dragging people back to wherever he came from. Not being a superstitious person, I never believed in it. Now I do. Why? Because when I checked the news later that day the woman I had picked up was found, dead. Not too strange, but definitely creepy that they found her body. The part that got me was the fact that police said she was dead for at least a month before they found her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a few more stories that I might tell tomorrow, but if your from Detroit or if you just have any info on the Nain Rouge I&amp;#39;d love to hear it, because the last sighting of it was back in 1976, but I know it&amp;#39;s still around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I don\\'t think anyone will recover from what happened today in school. I am the last one to get interrogated from my class.\\n\\n\"Please, take a seat, Ren\" suggested officer Micheal while pulling out the chair from under the table.\\n\\nI was still in shock, I couldn\\'t get myself to speak.\\n\\n\"Ren, could you please tell me what happened to you today?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s not one more possible thing I could say that you, sir, don\\'t already know. What\\'s even the point in this?\" I objected\\n\\n\"Ren, please, we just want to make sure that no information or detail is left out.\" he was lying, even he had enough of this twisted story, I could see it on his face, but I can\\'t blame him, everyone wants to forget what happened, it\\'s just his duty to interrogate us\\n\\n\"Everything is going to be fine,\" said Mrs. Hailey, trying to calm me down, she\\'s the school psychologist, she is always so nice \"You aren\\'t in any trouble. What you guys just went through is a serious traumatic event, we understand that it\\'s hard for you to speak about this, you don\\'t have to do this if you don\\'t want to.\" Officer Micheal shot a quick confused look towards Mrs. Hailey\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s okay, I\\'ll start from the beginning.\"\\n\\n\"And just remember, you can stop whenever you feel like it\\'s getting too much for you to handle\" comforted me Mrs. Hailey.\\n\\nThe date is July 14th, in school, there were only two classes that were still going to school, that is my class, and the other class which was situated right at the end of the hall, while our class was placed at the front of the hall, point being that there was a great distance between the two rooms.\\n\\nThe reason as to why the two classes still had to go to school was that in our school it is necessary for these specific classes to go and \"practice\" at a given job of their choosing, but of course, there were limitations when it came to actually choose one: that it had to be connected to what we want to pursue in college. The only bad side to this was of course that we had to make up for the lost time, by coming to school for the same amount of time that we missed out on.\\n\\nSo me and my 2 childhood best friends: Roxanna and Raiden, decided that we would choose toxicology, it was our shared passion.\\n\\nWe called ourselves the 3R\\'s when we were young. We do almost everything together, we hang out together, go shopping together, we shared almost all of our firsts. We mostly hang around Raidens place because, for one, he has the biggest house, two, his parents are really chill with us and for last because his parents aren\\'t even at home that much. While we were there we did any and everything that we came up with, from drinking from his parents\\' liquor and getting wasted until the point of one of us almost vomiting out their whole meal to putting as much makeup on Roxy to see when the face recognition would stop recognizing her.\\n\\nWe are like siblings, we always goof around, not caring about anything, no one has a bond as we have. It was in 1st grade that we made the pact of being best friends for life and that we\\'d always have each others back, it has been 10 years from then and we are still hanging on to that promise. \\n\\nThe main reason why we are so close to each other is that we went through the same pain. Me and Roxy have experienced the death of one of our parents, we were and still are judged for who we are, with Roxy being judged on her skin color and me and Raiden being judged over our sexual orientations.\\n\\nOne thing that bothered us when we got into high school was that Roxy got separated from us, she was a part of the other class, the one at the end of the hall. While it did suck that we wouldn\\'t be able to chat with her on the hours, it didn\\'t stop us one bit from being BFFs\\'.\\n\\nGetting back to the story, it was the last day of school -for us- and we were supposed to have 5 hours of chemistry, which was a pain in the ass for everyone, but not for me and Raiden. As usual, all three of us would meet up at my house to go together to school after, but this time that wasn\\'t quite the case, Roxy was nowhere to be found, we tried calling her, messaging her, we even tried to call her mother, but nothing.\\n\\nAfter for what seemed like 15 minutes, she sent a message in our group chat.\\n\\n\"*Hey guys, I won\\'t be able to make it...I\\'ll explain later why*.\"\\n\\nWe didn\\'t think much about it and just started to head to school.\\n\\n\"Do you think that they said something to her again?\" asked Raiden while on our way to school.\\n\\n\"I hope not. She has already gone through enough shit as it is,\" I replied \"I really hope she didn\\'t forget to take her meds.\"\\n\\nAfter her Dad died, she changed, and not in a good way. She became more and more quiet, she started bottling up her feelings, but not towards us. She told us how her Mother grew even more distant from her and the cherry on top was that she was getting bullied countless times by her classmates, we tried to do everything to stop it, we always intervened to help her out, we tried talking to her Mother about the problem, but with not much help, once we tried to convince the principal to let her be a part of our class, but he didn\\'t care at all...they only care when it\\'s too late.\\n\\nThe only thing that helped her was our support and the prescription drugs that her therapist gave her.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nWe finally arrive in school, still worrying about what could\\'ve possibly happened to Roxy.\\n\\n\"Hey, guess what,\" said Stacy while having the biggest smile on her face. She and her twin sister Avery sit at the back of our desks. They\\'re nice, well, somewhat, they are the gossipers of the class. \"the chem teacher didn\\'t come in today.\"\\n\\n\"Which means that we\\'ll have hours with a sub teacher,\" affirmed Avery \"let\\'s just hope it\\'s not gonna be Mr. Dinkins, or else this will be our last day alive.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning class.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning Mrs. Judy.\"\\n\\n\"Now, I know that today you guys were supposed to have chemistry hours, but sadly she couldn\\'t come in today, for an unknown reason,\" exclaimed Mrs. Judy \"so how about we just watch some movies, it\\'s either way your last day of school. You can pick any movie of your choice, as long as you don\\'t use your phones, deal?\"\\n\\nOf course, everyone nodded, it was like a gift from the heavens for us high school teenagers. The majority of the class wanted to watch a horror movie, so we did. I myself wasn\\'t a big fan of horror, but it was better than learning, so I went along with it. The movie that the class picked was Happy Death Day 2U, I saw the first one already, it had an interesting concept.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nAfter a while, I started to get bored of it so I asked Mrs. Judy if I could get excused to go to the bathroom, she nodded in agreement, right before I went out I glanced over at Raiden, he was already asleep, guess the poor guy didn\\'t get much sleep.\\n\\nI plugged my earphones in while I was heading towards the bathroom, music kinda relaxes me. When I finished up with my business I decided to try and reach out to Roxy.\\n\\n\"*Hey, what\\'s going on? You\\'re making me and Raiden worried. At least just tell us if you\\'re ok*\"\\n\\nNot even one minute and I get a reply.\\n\\n\"*Yeah, I\\'m much better now, I\\'ll tell everything later :)* \"\\n\\n\"*Alright, talk to you later babe*\"\\n\\nJesus, the movie is so loud I can hear the banging and screaming from here, even with lofi hip-hop blasting in my earphones.\\n\\n\"*Raiden, the movie is really fucking loud, could you tell the teach to quiet it down, it\\'ll disturb the other class*.\"\\n\\n\"*Yeah, but why do you care so much about disturbing them anyway?*\"\\n\\n\"*I don\\'t, I just don\\'t want Mr. Dinkins to scold the heck out of us*\"\\n\\n\"*On it babe*\"\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nThe movie ended and Mrs. Judy decided that she will let us go home after she wrote down the absences.\\n\\n\"Damn it, I accidentally switched up the calendars. Could you please go switch it out, Ren?\" she asked disappointedly\\n\\n\"Sure, can Raiden come with me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes\"\\n\\n\"Why do I gotta come with you?\" asked Raiden when we moved past the first few classes\\n\\n\"So that Mr. Dinkins can bully you rather than me\" I said with a grin on my face.\\n\\n\"Haha, very funny.\"\\n\\n\"Besides, I wanted to tell you that Roxy messaged me and said that she\\'s feeling better.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a re-\"\\n\\nAnd there it was...\\n\\nRaiden opened the door.\\n\\nEveryone..*dead*\\n\\nEyes gouged out, their limbs either torn apart or bent backward just as their fingers...\\n\\nBurned...\\n\\nTorn apart...\\n\\nChests cut open, mutilated, a pool of blood\\n\\n~~So much fucking blood~~\\n\\nLips and eyes sew shut\\n\\n~~Oh god~~\\n\\nGuts dangled all over the place\\n\\nSome of the faces were dissolved \\n\\nI cried, dropping the calendar to cover my nose from that putrid odor.\\n\\nI could hear Raiden puking next to me. I couldn\\'t get my eyes off of them, even if I could, this will be petrified in my mind forever...\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n29 victims...28 students and one professor, a cold-blooded massacre.\\n\\n~~All of the screaming and banging~~\\n\\nA cold-blooded massacre and a house fire on the same day.\\n\\nRoxys\\' house... *gone*\\n\\n\"Thank you for your time, Ren,\" said officer Micheal, bringing me back to reality \"and we\\'re sorry for your loss...\"\\n\\n\"Me too\" one of those students was Micheals\\' nephew, I think his name was Lucas.\\n\\n\"You can go home now\" said Mrs. Hailey.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n\"Roxy...\" I started.\\n\\n\"I already know.\"\\n\\n...see, everyone knew that Roxy was getting bullied and harassed, if it wouldn\\'t be for the accident, they would most likely blame her for this.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing...the fire had presumably started early in the morning...\\n\\n~~Her message~~\\n\\nAnd there\\'s no possible way she could\\'ve ended everyone in such a short amount of time without anyone noticing.\\n\\nAlso, there were some ,special, chemicals found in their bodies, and the storage in which the highly dangerous chemicals were kept was completely ruined...only one person had a key to it.\\n\\n~~The chemistry teacher didn\\'t come today~~\\n\\nMaybe some of you won\\'t understand, not like me and Raiden, but BFFs\\' are for a lifetime...and we always, **always** have each others back.\\n\\nRoxy, already covered us once, now it was just our turn to return the favor...',\n",

I am the last one to get interrogated from my class.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please, take a seat, Ren&amp;quot; suggested officer Micheal while pulling out the chair from under the table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was still in shock, I couldn&amp;#39;t get myself to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ren, could you please tell me what happened to you today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s not one more possible thing I could say that you, sir, don&amp;#39;t already know. What&amp;#39;s even the point in this?&amp;quot; I objected&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ren, please, we just want to make sure that no information or detail is left out.&amp;quot; he was lying, even he had enough of this twisted story, I could see it on his face, but I can&amp;#39;t blame him, everyone wants to forget what happened, it&amp;#39;s just his duty to interrogate us&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything is going to be fine,&amp;quot; said Mrs. Hailey, trying to calm me down, she&amp;#39;s the school psychologist, she is always so nice &amp;quot;You aren&amp;#39;t in any trouble. What you guys just went through is a serious traumatic event, we understand that it&amp;#39;s hard for you to speak about this, you don&amp;#39;t have to do this if you don&amp;#39;t want to.&amp;quot; Officer Micheal shot a quick confused look towards Mrs. Hailey&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, it&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;ll start from the beginning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And just remember, you can stop whenever you feel like it&amp;#39;s getting too much for you to handle&amp;quot; comforted me Mrs. Hailey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The date is July 14th, in school, there were only two classes that were still going to school, that is my class, and the other class which was situated right at the end of the hall, while our class was placed at the front of the hall, point being that there was a great distance between the two rooms.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The reason as to why the two classes still had to go to school was that in our school it is necessary for these specific classes to go and &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; at a given job of their choosing, but of course, there were limitations when it came to actually choose one: that it had to be connected to what we want to pursue in college. The only bad side to this was of course that we had to make up for the lost time, by coming to school for the same amount of time that we missed out on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So me and my 2 childhood best friends: Roxanna and Raiden, decided that we would choose toxicology, it was our shared passion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We called ourselves the 3R&amp;#39;s when we were young. We do almost everything together, we hang out together, go shopping together, we shared almost all of our firsts. We mostly hang around Raidens place because, for one, he has the biggest house, two, his parents are really chill with us and for last because his parents aren&amp;#39;t even at home that much. While we were there we did any and everything that we came up with, from drinking from his parents&amp;#39; liquor and getting wasted until the point of one of us almost vomiting out their whole meal to putting as much makeup on Roxy to see when the face recognition would stop recognizing her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We are like siblings, we always goof around, not caring about anything, no one has a bond as we have. It was in 1st grade that we made the pact of being best friends for life and that we&amp;#39;d always have each others back, it has been 10 years from then and we are still hanging on to that promise. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason why we are so close to each other is that we went through the same pain. Me and Roxy have experienced the death of one of our parents, we were and still are judged for who we are, with Roxy being judged on her skin color and me and Raiden being judged over our sexual orientations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that bothered us when we got into high school was that Roxy got separated from us, she was a part of the other class, the one at the end of the hall. While it did suck that we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to chat with her on the hours, it didn&amp;#39;t stop us one bit from being BFFs&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the story, it was the last day of school -for us- and we were supposed to have 5 hours of chemistry, which was a pain in the ass for everyone, but not for me and Raiden. As usual, all three of us would meet up at my house to go together to school after, but this time that wasn&amp;#39;t quite the case, Roxy was nowhere to be found, we tried calling her, messaging her, we even tried to call her mother, but nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After for what seemed like 15 minutes, she sent a message in our group chat.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey guys, I won&amp;#39;t be able to make it...I&amp;#39;ll explain later why&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t think much about it and just started to head to school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think that they said something to her again?&amp;quot; asked Raiden while on our way to school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope not. She has already gone through enough shit as it is,&amp;quot; I replied &amp;quot;I really hope she didn&amp;#39;t forget to take her meds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After her Dad died, she changed, and not in a good way. She became more and more quiet, she started bottling up her feelings, but not towards us. She told us how her Mother grew even more distant from her and the cherry on top was that she was getting bullied countless times by her classmates, we tried to do everything to stop it, we always intervened to help her out, we tried talking to her Mother about the problem, but with not much help, once we tried to convince the principal to let her be a part of our class, but he didn&amp;#39;t care at all...they only care when it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that helped her was our support and the prescription drugs that her therapist gave her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We finally arrive in school, still worrying about what could&amp;#39;ve possibly happened to Roxy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, guess what,&amp;quot; said Stacy while having the biggest smile on her face. She and her twin sister Avery sit at the back of our desks. They&amp;#39;re nice, well, somewhat, they are the gossipers of the class. &amp;quot;the chem teacher didn&amp;#39;t come in today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Which means that we&amp;#39;ll have hours with a sub teacher,&amp;quot; affirmed Avery &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s just hope it&amp;#39;s not gonna be Mr. Dinkins, or else this will be our last day alive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning class.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning Mrs. Judy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, I know that today you guys were supposed to have chemistry hours, but sadly she couldn&amp;#39;t come in today, for an unknown reason,&amp;quot; exclaimed Mrs. Judy &amp;quot;so how about we just watch some movies, it&amp;#39;s either way your last day of school. You can pick any movie of your choice, as long as you don&amp;#39;t use your phones, deal?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, everyone nodded, it was like a gift from the heavens for us high school teenagers. The majority of the class wanted to watch a horror movie, so we did. I myself wasn&amp;#39;t a big fan of horror, but it was better than learning, so I went along with it. The movie that the class picked was Happy Death Day 2U, I saw the first one already, it had an interesting concept.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a while, I started to get bored of it so I asked Mrs. Judy if I could get excused to go to the bathroom, she nodded in agreement, right before I went out I glanced over at Raiden, he was already asleep, guess the poor guy didn&amp;#39;t get much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I plugged my earphones in while I was heading towards the bathroom, music kinda relaxes me. When I finished up with my business I decided to try and reach out to Roxy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, what&amp;#39;s going on? You&amp;#39;re making me and Raiden worried. At least just tell us if you&amp;#39;re ok&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not even one minute and I get a reply.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, I&amp;#39;m much better now, I&amp;#39;ll tell everything later :)&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Alright, talk to you later babe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the movie is so loud I can hear the banging and screaming from here, even with lofi hip-hop blasting in my earphones.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Raiden, the movie is really fucking loud, could you tell the teach to quiet it down, it&amp;#39;ll disturb the other class&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, but why do you care so much about disturbing them anyway?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t, I just don&amp;#39;t want Mr. Dinkins to scold the heck out of us&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;On it babe&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The movie ended and Mrs. Judy decided that she will let us go home after she wrote down the absences.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn it, I accidentally switched up the calendars. Could you please go switch it out, Ren?&amp;quot; she asked disappointedly&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure, can Raiden come with me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do I gotta come with you?&amp;quot; asked Raiden when we moved past the first few classes&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So that Mr. Dinkins can bully you rather than me&amp;quot; I said with a grin on my face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Haha, very funny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Besides, I wanted to tell you that Roxy messaged me and said that she&amp;#39;s feeling better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a re-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And there it was...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raiden opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone..&lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Eyes gouged out, their limbs either torn apart or bent backward just as their fingers...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Burned...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Torn apart...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Chests cut open, mutilated, a pool of blood&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;So much fucking blood&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Lips and eyes sew shut&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Oh god&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guts dangled all over the place&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the faces were dissolved &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I cried, dropping the calendar to cover my nose from that putrid odor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could hear Raiden puking next to me. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my eyes off of them, even if I could, this will be petrified in my mind forever...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;29 victims...28 students and one professor, a cold-blooded massacre.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;All of the screaming and banging&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A cold-blooded massacre and a house fire on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roxys&amp;#39; house... &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you for your time, Ren,&amp;quot; said officer Micheal, bringing me back to reality &amp;quot;and we&amp;#39;re sorry for your loss...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Me too&amp;quot; one of those students was Micheals&amp;#39; nephew, I think his name was Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can go home now&amp;quot; said Mrs. Hailey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Roxy...&amp;quot; I started.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I already know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;...see, everyone knew that Roxy was getting bullied and harassed, if it wouldn&amp;#39;t be for the accident, they would most likely blame her for this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the thing...the fire had presumably started early in the morning...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Her message&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no possible way she could&amp;#39;ve ended everyone in such a short amount of time without anyone noticing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there were some ,special, chemicals found in their bodies, and the storage in which the highly dangerous chemicals were kept was completely ruined...only one person had a key to it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;The chemistry teacher didn&amp;#39;t come today&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you won&amp;#39;t understand, not like me and Raiden, but BFFs&amp;#39; are for a lifetime...and we always, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; have each others back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Roxy, already covered us once, now it was just our turn to return the favor...&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

And you know, disposing of a human body isn\\'t as easy as I thought it\\'d be. Turns out walking into a Chuck E Cheese with a trash bag that\\'s leaves a red streak on the floor can\\'t exactly be waived off as pizza sauce. Especially when a cult is there for an event. \\n\\n\\n\"Shit! I forgot today was the cults event\" I said, turning to my exhausted friend, Andrew, who hadn\\'t gotten any sleep the night before. The white vans of the cult filled the parking lot, as did a few squad cars who were there to make sure things didn\\'t get too out of hand. The trash bags already smelled of rotten meat, but they\\'d have to stay until after hours from the looks of it. \\n\\n\\n\"They\\'ll be fine dude. Let\\'s just go in, and act like nothing happened. They probably need us\"\\n\\n\\nWhen we got in, for once the place was quiet. The cult\\'s children were playing games sure but the adults all sat quietly conversing amongst themselves. It was kind of eerie. Like going into an empty grocery store or a school after hours. You get used to the noise so without it, it just *feels* weird you know?\\n\\n\\nAndrew went to the kitchen, while Dwight greeted me in my office. I noticed when I entered that the costume was gone. Slightly worrying. I sat across from him, behind my desk, and he spoke after a few seconds.\\n\\n\\n\"Do you know why corporate sent me here?\" I could take a guess but shook my head anyway. \"Because this place is the most problematic site in the region. Malfunctioning machinery, employee negligence and bad press are all that come out of this shit heap. Not to mention your best paying customers are a bunch of backwater cultist fucks\" \\n\\n\\n\"You going somewhere with this?\" \"Yes. I am. Starting today, no more mentions of \\'Gary\\' or any of these stupid fucking ghost stories you people have. There is NOTHING in the ball pit. There is no teleporting video game. Do you understand me?\" I shrugged, a bit uncomfortable. Mainly because I really wanted to correct him.\\n\\n\\nHe left my office, slamming the door behind him. I sighed, took out a smoke, and breathed in an air of nicotine fueled cancer. If this place didn\\'t kill me, the smoking sure would. I was up all night about the whole Al situation. The real one was dead. So who, or what, were we really working with? As if on cue, Al stepped into my office.\\n\\n\\n\"Marcus, may I speak with you?\" Before I could respond he sat and spoke, the same smile plastered on his face. \"I\\'m sorry to disturb you, it\\'s just that-\" \"Let me stop you right there.\" I took out the wallet and threw it to him. \"Who\\'s that?\" I said, as he looked at the ID. \"That\\'s me sir.\"\\n\\n\\nI half laughed half snorted. \"That\\'s not possible. That man\\'s…well let\\'s just say he\\'s out of town. Left his wallet at the bus station.\"\\n\\n\\nHe closed it, and looked at me, still smiling. \"You know, Marcus, who lives at 32 Maple Road (not my real address, but he did say it), it\\'s dangerous living alone.\" He tilted his head, reminding me a bit of a slasher movie villain. \"Accidents happen. All the time. Dangerous ones. I mean. One misstep and you could have a broken neck. Especially if one doesn\\'t lock his doors when he arrives home.\" His smile didn\\'t drop, and I nearly pissed myself.\\n\\n\\n\"Is that a threat?\" He chuckled \"No Marcus. It\\'s whatever you want to perceive it as.\" He crushed the wallet in his hands, with such force, the leather tore in his grip. His brown eyes flashed a red for a second.\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be going back to work now\" He stood, and left, shutting the door with such force that it actually fucked up the frame a bit. Ok. He wasn\\'t human. That settled it. But what was he? \\n\\n\\n*Ring*\\n\\n\\nOh great. Just what I needed. I answered it, and the voice said\\n\\n\\n\"Hello. This is me. Let me in\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh fuck off pal\" I said, finally having enough and unplugging the phone from the wall. Then it rang again. I turned around, and nearly shat myself. The costume was back in the office. The nauseating stench of it overwhelmed my nostrils and I nearly gagged. It held a balloon in its hands, with the words \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" written sloppily in black marker.\\n\\n\\nI stepped out of the office, and saw the cult loading food for takeout. We don\\'t normally allow it but quite frankly they scared us shitless. Yes, even with Al nearby. After they left, Andrew and I made our move. We tossed the bloody garbage bags to Gary, and watched as they disappeared in the ball pit.\\n\\n\\nI noticed Al watch out of the corner of my eye, and he put a lip to his finger. I gulped and asked Andrew if he wanted to go \\'loosen up\\' in the basement. By loosen up, I mean get stoned of course. We passed a joint between us in the basement, which I still wasn\\'t thrilled to return to.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t tell Andrew this, seeing as he was stressed enough, but I noticed the costume in the darkness. It\\'s stench was masked, somehow, and I faintly made out a balloon. Andrew was called up by Dwight, so after he left, I, against my better judgement, investigated. The balloon now said \\'aLwAYS WAtchINg U\\' in the same messy sharpie.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s when it grabbed my shoulder. I jumped back, and the thing stepped towards me. What the hell did Andrew put in that weed. It grabbed me and said in a low pitched growl\\n\\n\\n**\"I\\'m real\"**\\n\\n\\nSaying fuck this shit, I pushed it away, ran up stairs, and locked the door shut behind me. \"Mark what the fuck were you doing down there for so long?\" Andrew asked, startled. Turned out I was down there for 20 minutes after Andrew had came up. I noticed the things dirty handprint on my shoulder, and hid it.\\n\\n\\nJust then, a wheel of cheese, and a few small slices of pepperoni, rolled passed both of us, stopped, did a little gesture as if to nod, and kept on rolling. One of the kitchen staff came by in hot pursuit.\\n\\n\\n\"What the fuck was that?\" \"Just another day at Chuck E. Cheese.\" I said, watching him chase after the piece of dairy and pizza toppings. Sometimes I forget how funnily weird this place can be, instead of, you know, pants shittingly terrifying. It\\'s certainly one of a kind. \\n\\n\\nI still haven\\'t told Andrew about my conversation with Al, or my encounters in the basement. Not sure I want to. It\\'s probably for the best. Don\\'t want to stress the poor guy out.\\n\\n\\nAlso there was something outside of my house earlier tonight. I don\\'t know what. All I know is my neighbors dog is missing, and there are footprints like a mascot costume in the mud around the neighborhood. Looks like work followed me home.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, That\\'s all I have for you guys tonight. I\\'ll see you all around.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Hey guys. Upon advice from a few of you guys, I have today off. I\\'ll be researching the building and the land it was built on! I\\'ll get back to you soon',\n",

And you know, disposing of a human body isn&amp;#39;t as easy as I thought it&amp;#39;d be. Turns out walking into a Chuck E Cheese with a trash bag that&amp;#39;s leaves a red streak on the floor can&amp;#39;t exactly be waived off as pizza sauce. Especially when a cult is there for an event. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shit! I forgot today was the cults event&amp;quot; I said, turning to my exhausted friend, Andrew, who hadn&amp;#39;t gotten any sleep the night before. The white vans of the cult filled the parking lot, as did a few squad cars who were there to make sure things didn&amp;#39;t get too out of hand. The trash bags already smelled of rotten meat, but they&amp;#39;d have to stay until after hours from the looks of it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ll be fine dude. Let&amp;#39;s just go in, and act like nothing happened. They probably need us&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we got in, for once the place was quiet. The cult&amp;#39;s children were playing games sure but the adults all sat quietly conversing amongst themselves. It was kind of eerie. Like going into an empty grocery store or a school after hours. You get used to the noise so without it, it just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; weird you know?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew went to the kitchen, while Dwight greeted me in my office. I noticed when I entered that the costume was gone. Slightly worrying. I sat across from him, behind my desk, and he spoke after a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you know why corporate sent me here?&amp;quot; I could take a guess but shook my head anyway. &amp;quot;Because this place is the most problematic site in the region. Malfunctioning machinery, employee negligence and bad press are all that come out of this shit heap. Not to mention your best paying customers are a bunch of backwater cultist fucks&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You going somewhere with this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes. I am. Starting today, no more mentions of &amp;#39;Gary&amp;#39; or any of these stupid fucking ghost stories you people have. There is NOTHING in the ball pit. There is no teleporting video game. Do you understand me?&amp;quot; I shrugged, a bit uncomfortable. Mainly because I really wanted to correct him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He left my office, slamming the door behind him. I sighed, took out a smoke, and breathed in an air of nicotine fueled cancer. If this place didn&amp;#39;t kill me, the smoking sure would. I was up all night about the whole Al situation. The real one was dead. So who, or what, were we really working with? As if on cue, Al stepped into my office.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Marcus, may I speak with you?&amp;quot; Before I could respond he sat and spoke, the same smile plastered on his face. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry to disturb you, it&amp;#39;s just that-&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Let me stop you right there.&amp;quot; I took out the wallet and threw it to him. &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot; I said, as he looked at the ID. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s me sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I half laughed half snorted. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not possible. That man&amp;#39;s…well let&amp;#39;s just say he&amp;#39;s out of town. Left his wallet at the bus station.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He closed it, and looked at me, still smiling. &amp;quot;You know, Marcus, who lives at 32 Maple Road (not my real address, but he did say it), it&amp;#39;s dangerous living alone.&amp;quot; He tilted his head, reminding me a bit of a slasher movie villain. &amp;quot;Accidents happen. All the time. Dangerous ones. I mean. One misstep and you could have a broken neck. Especially if one doesn&amp;#39;t lock his doors when he arrives home.&amp;quot; His smile didn&amp;#39;t drop, and I nearly pissed myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that a threat?&amp;quot; He chuckled &amp;quot;No Marcus. It&amp;#39;s whatever you want to perceive it as.&amp;quot; He crushed the wallet in his hands, with such force, the leather tore in his grip. His brown eyes flashed a red for a second.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be going back to work now&amp;quot; He stood, and left, shutting the door with such force that it actually fucked up the frame a bit. Ok. He wasn&amp;#39;t human. That settled it. But what was he? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh great. Just what I needed. I answered it, and the voice said&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello. This is me. Let me in&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh fuck off pal&amp;quot; I said, finally having enough and unplugging the phone from the wall. Then it rang again. I turned around, and nearly shat myself. The costume was back in the office. The nauseating stench of it overwhelmed my nostrils and I nearly gagged. It held a balloon in its hands, with the words &amp;quot;HAPPY BIRTHDAY&amp;quot; written sloppily in black marker.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped out of the office, and saw the cult loading food for takeout. We don&amp;#39;t normally allow it but quite frankly they scared us shitless. Yes, even with Al nearby. After they left, Andrew and I made our move. We tossed the bloody garbage bags to Gary, and watched as they disappeared in the ball pit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed Al watch out of the corner of my eye, and he put a lip to his finger. I gulped and asked Andrew if he wanted to go &amp;#39;loosen up&amp;#39; in the basement. By loosen up, I mean get stoned of course. We passed a joint between us in the basement, which I still wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled to return to.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t tell Andrew this, seeing as he was stressed enough, but I noticed the costume in the darkness. It&amp;#39;s stench was masked, somehow, and I faintly made out a balloon. Andrew was called up by Dwight, so after he left, I, against my better judgement, investigated. The balloon now said &amp;#39;aLwAYS WAtchINg U&amp;#39; in the same messy sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when it grabbed my shoulder. I jumped back, and the thing stepped towards me. What the hell did Andrew put in that weed. It grabbed me and said in a low pitched growl&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m real&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Saying fuck this shit, I pushed it away, ran up stairs, and locked the door shut behind me. &amp;quot;Mark what the fuck were you doing down there for so long?&amp;quot; Andrew asked, startled. Turned out I was down there for 20 minutes after Andrew had came up. I noticed the things dirty handprint on my shoulder, and hid it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just then, a wheel of cheese, and a few small slices of pepperoni, rolled passed both of us, stopped, did a little gesture as if to nod, and kept on rolling. One of the kitchen staff came by in hot pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the fuck was that?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Just another day at Chuck E. Cheese.&amp;quot; I said, watching him chase after the piece of dairy and pizza toppings. Sometimes I forget how funnily weird this place can be, instead of, you know, pants shittingly terrifying. It&amp;#39;s certainly one of a kind. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still haven&amp;#39;t told Andrew about my conversation with Al, or my encounters in the basement. Not sure I want to. It&amp;#39;s probably for the best. Don&amp;#39;t want to stress the poor guy out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also there was something outside of my house earlier tonight. I don&amp;#39;t know what. All I know is my neighbors dog is missing, and there are footprints like a mascot costume in the mud around the neighborhood. Looks like work followed me home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, That&amp;#39;s all I have for you guys tonight. I&amp;#39;ll see you all around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Hey guys. Upon advice from a few of you guys, I have today off. I&amp;#39;ll be researching the building and the land it was built on! I&amp;#39;ll get back to you soon&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '*I\\'m still not sure if* [the raven](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c26e94/an_enormous_raven_visits_me_every_five_years_each/) *is causing the deaths or trying to warn me of tragedies to come.*\\n\\n*I guess I\\'ll find out soon enough.*\\n\\nAfter the sudden deaths of her husband and brother, my mother changed. It wasn\\'t for the better. Losing two of the closest people in her life in just a few years had forced her to see the fragility of existence—in a way she need not before. Her feeling of trepidation increased day by day like clockwork, until I was barely even allowed to leave the house.\\n\\nWhen I was 13, I had told her about the raven and how it was connected to the tragedies. Maybe most parents wouldn\\'t have believed a child about such things, thinking it a coping mechanism or some sort of fantasy.\\n\\nBut she believed me.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, *it haunted her.*\\n\\nShe began to fear birds of all kinds, even going as far as adopting four house cats and leaving them to patrol our property outside. I explained to her that the raven had only appeared on two separate days spanning a period of five years, but it didn\\'t matter.\\n\\nEvery morning upon awaking I would reluctantly make my way down the hallway towards her room. The same sight always greeted me. My mother would be sitting in the corner of her bedroom in darkness, gliding back and forth on an old rocking chair that my father had made for her himself years ago. Her once beautiful form had slowly withered away, and from a distance she now looked like an old woman.\\n\\nEach day since the death of her brother, she had lost a small piece of her mind... and began to delve further and further into madness. I could hear her whispers as she stared blankly out through the second story window and into the trees in the back of our property. She repeated the same mantra almost word for word.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill the bird. I\\'ll kill it first. I\\'ll kill the raven first.\"\\n\\nI pretended I hadn\\'t heard her.\\n\\n\"Mom, I\\'m going to school now.\"\\n\\nAfter a few moments, she snapped partially back into reality.\\n\\n\"What? Oh... be safe Joey.\"\\n\\n\"I know mom. I will be.\"\\n\\nI turned around quickly and headed down the stairs towards the front door and the carpool that awaited me.\\n\\n\"And come home right after school! I don\\'t want you going anywhere else tonight!\"\\n\\nThe worry in her voice was a constant at this point, and I hadn\\'t been allowed over a friends house in months. Maybe even years?\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, is that I was now 18 years old. Almost five years exactly had passed since the second incident, and ten years from the death of my father.\\n\\nJune 21st approached, and my mother hadn\\'t slept in over a week. She almost never rose up from the warm birch rocking chair. The first time I had heard the loud thud of the gun falling from her hands onto the cold floor, it had sent a shiver up my spine. I thought my mother had fallen or had some type of accident.\\n\\nEntering her room, I had seen her completely passed out and the shotgun she had been holding on the ground next to her. I tried to wake her, but had no luck. My father or uncle had never taught me about gun safety, and I had second thoughts about picking the loaded firearm up.\\n\\nSo I googled it. Turns out that in fact the safety *was off, and* it wasn\\'t beyond possibility that the thing could have fired when she dropped it on the floor. The next morning, I tried to explain how dangerous her holding a loaded gun in her current sleep depraved condition was.\\n\\nShe slapped me hard... a single time across my face.\\n\\nAnd then she began to cry.\\n\\n\"Joey... oh Joey... I\\'m so sorry. I\\'m so sorry,\" she continued, sobbing loudly now and putting her arms around me.\\n\\n\"It\\'s ok mom. It\\'s ok,\" I replied, hugging her back.\\n\\nBut I knew it wasn\\'t, and the first chance I got—I replaced the live ammunition in the gun with dummy rounds. I knew I could never tell her.\\n\\nThe morning of June 21st was the same, except worse. My mother hadn\\'t slept in possibly weeks, and the night brought her madness to a peak. In anticipation of the raven\\'s arrival, she had nailed shut every window save one in the house. The four cats were out patrolling in the yard, and seemed more vigilant. Perhaps they were eagerly awaiting the task to which held their purpose. I had already been called out of school tomorrow on a family emergency, and my friends had no idea why I wasn\\'t allowed to be in contact.\\n\\nI was far too embarrassed to explain my situation.\\n\\nMy mother had also bought two new fire extinguishers, and had the gas and electrical lines checked for any signs of danger. She did her best to predict any possible accident in order to protect us, but it wouldn\\'t be enough.\\n\\nAs the clock struck midnight and the day of the raven came, her chants seemed to hold more importance. As I tried to sleep, the same words echoed through the walls, but with more power than before.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill the raven first. I\\'ll kill it first.\"\\n\\nMorning came, and this time when I walked into my mothers room—it wasn\\'t to find her asleep. Instead of sitting in her rocking chair, I found her standing vigilantly, the edge of the shotgun perched precariously out towards the trees behind us. This was the only window left unblocked in the entire house, and she guarded it with her life.\\n\\nThe afternoon passed by like any other, and the evening came quicker than usual. As the sun began to set, I started to wonder if the two of us had indeed broken whatever curse was upon us, or our family.\\n\\nAnd then... it was there.\\n\\nI saw it first, perched up at eye level about 30 yards away in an old pine tree my father had meant to cut down years ago.\\n\\nMy mother\\'s eyes froze in fear, as I heard the bird caw for the first time.\\n\\n\"Get back Joey!\" she yelled, aiming at the dark figure in the tree.\\n\\nIt cawed for a second time, and I think its head turned to focus on my mother.\\n\\nShe finished aiming, and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n*But nothing happened.*\\n\\nShe had found the old gun in the attic years ago, but with her mental state declining she had never done any maintenance, and the gun hadn\\'t been fired in years.\\n\\nTime stopped, and I heard the third and last caw.\\n\\n\"Joey!\" she screamed, getting the bird again in her sights.\\n\\n\"Mom, stop! We\\'re safe!\" I urged her.\\n\\nBut she wouldn\\'t listen, and weeks of not sleeping had taken a toll on her balance. The raven flew back into the sky, and as she tried to keep it in her sights, she tripped and fell backwards onto the floor.\\n\\nThis time, the gun did indeed fire—and in the closed room the noise was deafening.\\n\\nShe must have replaced the dummy ammunition in the gun I realized sadly, as I stared over at the face of my desperate mother. The gun had fired a live round into her chest, and she was barely able to speak.\\n\\nThe last thing I remember before her eyes closed for a last time, was her reaching her arms out towards me and mouthing four words.\\n\\n*\"Joey... kill the raven.\"*\\n\\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/user/LighthouseHorror)',\n",

It wasn&amp;#39;t for the better. Losing two of the closest people in her life in just a few years had forced her to see the fragility of existence—in a way she need not before. Her feeling of trepidation increased day by day like clockwork, until I was barely even allowed to leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 13, I had told her about the raven and how it was connected to the tragedies. Maybe most parents wouldn&amp;#39;t have believed a child about such things, thinking it a coping mechanism or some sort of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she believed me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, &lt;em&gt;it haunted her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She began to fear birds of all kinds, even going as far as adopting four house cats and leaving them to patrol our property outside. I explained to her that the raven had only appeared on two separate days spanning a period of five years, but it didn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Every morning upon awaking I would reluctantly make my way down the hallway towards her room. The same sight always greeted me. My mother would be sitting in the corner of her bedroom in darkness, gliding back and forth on an old rocking chair that my father had made for her himself years ago. Her once beautiful form had slowly withered away, and from a distance she now looked like an old woman.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each day since the death of her brother, she had lost a small piece of her mind... and began to delve further and further into madness. I could hear her whispers as she stared blankly out through the second story window and into the trees in the back of our property. She repeated the same mantra almost word for word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll kill the bird. I&amp;#39;ll kill it first. I&amp;#39;ll kill the raven first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pretended I hadn&amp;#39;t heard her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom, I&amp;#39;m going to school now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a few moments, she snapped partially back into reality.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What? Oh... be safe Joey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know mom. I will be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around quickly and headed down the stairs towards the front door and the carpool that awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And come home right after school! I don&amp;#39;t want you going anywhere else tonight!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The worry in her voice was a constant at this point, and I hadn&amp;#39;t been allowed over a friends house in months. Maybe even years?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, is that I was now 18 years old. Almost five years exactly had passed since the second incident, and ten years from the death of my father.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;June 21st approached, and my mother hadn&amp;#39;t slept in over a week. She almost never rose up from the warm birch rocking chair. The first time I had heard the loud thud of the gun falling from her hands onto the cold floor, it had sent a shiver up my spine. I thought my mother had fallen or had some type of accident.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Entering her room, I had seen her completely passed out and the shotgun she had been holding on the ground next to her. I tried to wake her, but had no luck. My father or uncle had never taught me about gun safety, and I had second thoughts about picking the loaded firearm up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I googled it. Turns out that in fact the safety &lt;em&gt;was off, and&lt;/em&gt; it wasn&amp;#39;t beyond possibility that the thing could have fired when she dropped it on the floor. The next morning, I tried to explain how dangerous her holding a loaded gun in her current sleep depraved condition was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She slapped me hard... a single time across my face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then she began to cry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Joey... oh Joey... I&amp;#39;m so sorry. I&amp;#39;m so sorry,&amp;quot; she continued, sobbing loudly now and putting her arms around me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s ok mom. It&amp;#39;s ok,&amp;quot; I replied, hugging her back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t, and the first chance I got—I replaced the live ammunition in the gun with dummy rounds. I knew I could never tell her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The morning of June 21st was the same, except worse. My mother hadn&amp;#39;t slept in possibly weeks, and the night brought her madness to a peak. In anticipation of the raven&amp;#39;s arrival, she had nailed shut every window save one in the house. The four cats were out patrolling in the yard, and seemed more vigilant. Perhaps they were eagerly awaiting the task to which held their purpose. I had already been called out of school tomorrow on a family emergency, and my friends had no idea why I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to be in contact.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was far too embarrassed to explain my situation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother had also bought two new fire extinguishers, and had the gas and electrical lines checked for any signs of danger. She did her best to predict any possible accident in order to protect us, but it wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the clock struck midnight and the day of the raven came, her chants seemed to hold more importance. As I tried to sleep, the same words echoed through the walls, but with more power than before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll kill the raven first. I&amp;#39;ll kill it first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Morning came, and this time when I walked into my mothers room—it wasn&amp;#39;t to find her asleep. Instead of sitting in her rocking chair, I found her standing vigilantly, the edge of the shotgun perched precariously out towards the trees behind us. This was the only window left unblocked in the entire house, and she guarded it with her life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The afternoon passed by like any other, and the evening came quicker than usual. As the sun began to set, I started to wonder if the two of us had indeed broken whatever curse was upon us, or our family.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then... it was there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I saw it first, perched up at eye level about 30 yards away in an old pine tree my father had meant to cut down years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mother&amp;#39;s eyes froze in fear, as I heard the bird caw for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get back Joey!&amp;quot; she yelled, aiming at the dark figure in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It cawed for a second time, and I think its head turned to focus on my mother.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She finished aiming, and pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But nothing happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She had found the old gun in the attic years ago, but with her mental state declining she had never done any maintenance, and the gun hadn&amp;#39;t been fired in years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Time stopped, and I heard the third and last caw.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Joey!&amp;quot; she screamed, getting the bird again in her sights.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom, stop! We&amp;#39;re safe!&amp;quot; I urged her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But she wouldn&amp;#39;t listen, and weeks of not sleeping had taken a toll on her balance. The raven flew back into the sky, and as she tried to keep it in her sights, she tripped and fell backwards onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, the gun did indeed fire—and in the closed room the noise was deafening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She must have replaced the dummy ammunition in the gun I realized sadly, as I stared over at the face of my desperate mother. The gun had fired a live round into her chest, and she was barely able to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing I remember before her eyes closed for a last time, was her reaching her arms out towards me and mouthing four words.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Joey... kill the raven.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LighthouseHorror\"&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '  \\n\\nFor as long as I can remember, there has been a man in my bedroom window.\\n\\nIt seems strange to say, I know, but it is true. From the earliest, fuzziest memories I have all the way up to now, he’s been there. Looking at me.\\n\\nIn my first memories of him, he was an indistinct, blurry blob that was only vaguely man-shaped. My young mind didn’t think much of it, and hardly put much effort into understanding it. The man had always been there, standing motionlessly aside from a slight swaying motion that could have been a trick of the light. He didn’t really do anything, and his presence hardly gave off any sort of threatening vibes. He was simply just a constant, passive presence in my life, much like the sun or moon. I simply accepted the fact that he was just always there.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until I was 7 years old that I realized his presence wasn’t a normal thing, when, for the very first time, he moved.\\n\\nI didn’t really notice it at first, as I wandered sleepily into my room that night. I quickly changed into my pajamas and settled into bed as usual. I made a point to not look at the window at all during this process. I was plenty used to the man’s constant presence, but the idea of him watching me change still made me a bit uncomfortable. It helped to simply pretend he wasn’t there as I got ready for bed. As soon as I was all snuggled up in bed though, I would turn to face the window to say goodnight. Much like how other young children might say goodnight to the moon. \\n\\nIt was then that I saw his usually indistinct hand, which suddenly seemed a lot more solid as it pressed firmly into the glass, causing the frame to creak under the pressure. \\n\\nObviously startled by this, I rushed off to tell my parents. The looks on their faces when I told them that “the man in my window moved” were confused at first, then noticeably horrified. They rushed to my room, my mom carrying me along in her arms. When we got there, he man had returned to his usual position, standing motionless outside the window. When I tried to explain to my parents that, despite being back to normal, the man had definitely moved, they gave me a strange sort look. However, a flash of understanding passed across my dad’s face, and he leaned in to whisper something into Mom’s ear. She nodded in response and they both sighed in visible relief. I continued to try and frantically explain, but she just gently shushed me as she laid me down back into bed. I still clearly remember what she said to me as she tucked me in that night.\\n\\n“It’s okay honey. You just had a bad dream. There’s no man standing in your window.”\\n\\nIt took a couple of years, a few trips to a psychologist, and more than a few unpleasant encounters with kids at school, however, eventually, I learned to not talk about the man in my window. I learned that telling others about it would hardly do me any good, as there wasn’t exactly anything I could do to prove that he existed. Nobody but me could see him, and there was no way of physically interacting with him. He didn’t actually exist on the other side of the window. It was more like he was a reflection, or some kind of image projected directly onto the window. Left with little else to do, I simply shut up about it. Eventually, after some time, everyone else in my life simply forgot about it, passing the whole thing off as just some odd, childhood behavior. I never forgot though, of course. And I definitely never stopped seeing him.\\n\\nI did some research, of course, to try and figure out what the man in my window was. The best guess I could come up with was that he was a ghost or spirit of some kind, mostly because it was the only option I could find that made much of any sense. However, I couldn’t seem to find any information on any other instances of someone experiencing a similar situation. None of the somewhat dubious methods of either communicating with or getting rid of the man had worked either, so I eventually just gave up and went back to ignoring him for the most part. It wasn’t like worrying about his completely passive, non-aggressive existence in my life would do any sort of good anyway.\\n\\nThings would go on like this for quite a while. Years passed, and my family moved to a new house and new state in my high school years. I had entertained the possibility that the man might disappear or be left behind as a result of our move, but I wasn’t particularly disheartened to find him residing within my new bedroom window the first night after our move. Eventually I moved away for college and into the on-campus dorm. The man followed me there as well. College would eventually come to an end and, shortly after, I moved into my current apartment. At this point, I would have been more surprised if the man hadn’t followed me there.\\n\\nOver the years, his constant presence would be unchanging. However, there was something about the man that was slowly starting to change over time. I thought it was just my imagination at first. However, it slowly became clear that this wasn’t the case. As time went on, the man was steadily becoming more and more clear and distinct. Much like hair growth, it was very slow going but became more obvious over time. I began to be able to make out certain details about his appearance. The length and general shape of his hair, the color of his clothes, things like that. As of late, I have been able to somewhat make out the style of the clothes he is wearing as well; a plaid button-up and a pair of jeans, to be specific. Despite this though, for the longest time I wasn’t able to make out any of his facial features. No matter how clear the rest of him would become, his face would still remain as stubbornly blurry and indistinct as my earlier memories of him. Other than that though, it seemed like nothing much else change and that things would simply go on as normal.\\n\\nThat is, until last night.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up to the sound of banging. It was a desperate sort of racket, as if whoever was doing it was trying their very best to make as much noise as possible. I thought at first that it was someone at my front door, but I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. The sound was much too close for that. Finally, I turned my gaze to the bedroom window, and realized that it was him, the man in my window.\\n\\nI recoiled in fear, terrified by his sudden violence. It was the most I’d ever seen the man move, and certainly the most threatening he’d ever seemed. It took me a long moment of panicked breaths and adrenaline, but I eventually realized that he wasn’t able to get in. Rather, it seemed more like the man wasn’t even trying to. As if he was simply trying to get my attention. Having calmed down a bit, I decided to test this theory. I rose from my bed, putting on my glasses as I went, and drew closer to the window. Lo and behold, the man ceased his banging. \\n\\nHis body language, however, was still panicked and fearful. I couldn’t tell, since I still couldn’t see his face, but it almost seemed as if he was trying to yell something to me. However, he seemed incapable of speaking in a way I could hear, and I had no way of attempting to read his obscured lips. This quickly started to change though. The man was clearer than he had even been before, so clear that you could almost convince me that he was just a reflection. He was becoming even clearer by the second and, for the first time ever; I was beginning to be able to see his facial features. It started around the edges, giving me an idea of the general shape of his face. Then it started to draw in closer towards the center of his face. The more it revealed, though, the more familiar the man became. So familiar it was eerie. This familiarity shook me to my very core. I knew the man.\\n\\nIt was me.\\n\\nAnd he was screaming “RUN.”\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\nI am writing this from first train out of town that I was able to get tickets for this morning. A part of me thinks that I’m being a bit silly for doing this. However, an even bigger part of me thinks that I’d have to be an idiot to ignore the man’s… to ignore *my* warning. I don’t know where I’m headed, as I haven’t exactly been given clear instructions on where to go. All I can do at this point is hope that I’m headed away from whatever I should be running from. I suppose I’ll just have to see what the man in the window has to say tonight.',\n",

The best guess I could come up with was that he was a ghost or spirit of some kind, mostly because it was the only option I could find that made much of any sense. However, I couldn’t seem to find any information on any other instances of someone experiencing a similar situation. None of the somewhat dubious methods of either communicating with or getting rid of the man had worked either, so I eventually just gave up and went back to ignoring him for the most part. It wasn’t like worrying about his completely passive, non-aggressive existence in my life would do any sort of good anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Things would go on like this for quite a while. Years passed, and my family moved to a new house and new state in my high school years. I had entertained the possibility that the man might disappear or be left behind as a result of our move, but I wasn’t particularly disheartened to find him residing within my new bedroom window the first night after our move. Eventually I moved away for college and into the on-campus dorm. The man followed me there as well. College would eventually come to an end and, shortly after, I moved into my current apartment. At this point, I would have been more surprised if the man hadn’t followed me there.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Over the years, his constant presence would be unchanging. However, there was something about the man that was slowly starting to change over time. I thought it was just my imagination at first. However, it slowly became clear that this wasn’t the case. As time went on, the man was steadily becoming more and more clear and distinct. Much like hair growth, it was very slow going but became more obvious over time. I began to be able to make out certain details about his appearance. The length and general shape of his hair, the color of his clothes, things like that. As of late, I have been able to somewhat make out the style of the clothes he is wearing as well; a plaid button-up and a pair of jeans, to be specific. Despite this though, for the longest time I wasn’t able to make out any of his facial features. No matter how clear the rest of him would become, his face would still remain as stubbornly blurry and indistinct as my earlier memories of him. Other than that though, it seemed like nothing much else change and that things would simply go on as normal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That is, until last night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, I woke up to the sound of banging. It was a desperate sort of racket, as if whoever was doing it was trying their very best to make as much noise as possible. I thought at first that it was someone at my front door, but I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. The sound was much too close for that. Finally, I turned my gaze to the bedroom window, and realized that it was him, the man in my window.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I recoiled in fear, terrified by his sudden violence. It was the most I’d ever seen the man move, and certainly the most threatening he’d ever seemed. It took me a long moment of panicked breaths and adrenaline, but I eventually realized that he wasn’t able to get in. Rather, it seemed more like the man wasn’t even trying to. As if he was simply trying to get my attention. Having calmed down a bit, I decided to test this theory. I rose from my bed, putting on my glasses as I went, and drew closer to the window. Lo and behold, the man ceased his banging. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His body language, however, was still panicked and fearful. I couldn’t tell, since I still couldn’t see his face, but it almost seemed as if he was trying to yell something to me. However, he seemed incapable of speaking in a way I could hear, and I had no way of attempting to read his obscured lips. This quickly started to change though. The man was clearer than he had even been before, so clear that you could almost convince me that he was just a reflection. He was becoming even clearer by the second and, for the first time ever; I was beginning to be able to see his facial features. It started around the edges, giving me an idea of the general shape of his face. Then it started to draw in closer towards the center of his face. The more it revealed, though, the more familiar the man became. So familiar it was eerie. This familiarity shook me to my very core. I knew the man.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And he was screaming “RUN.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am writing this from first train out of town that I was able to get tickets for this morning. A part of me thinks that I’m being a bit silly for doing this. However, an even bigger part of me thinks that I’d have to be an idiot to ignore the man’s… to ignore &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; warning. I don’t know where I’m headed, as I haven’t exactly been given clear instructions on where to go. All I can do at this point is hope that I’m headed away from whatever I should be running from. I suppose I’ll just have to see what the man in the window has to say tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

New to all the demigod stuff, eh?” He smirked. \\n\\n“It’s a lot more than that— what?” I asked him. \\n\\n“I knew we had more in common than before. Allow me to reintroduce myself— Dr. Mark Smith, Son of Asclepius.” He held out his hand. I shook it. \\n\\n“Pretty generic name for a son of such a specialized god.” I sniffed back my tears to smirk. I wasn’t surprised by his identity, I knew something was off about him since I met him. \\n\\nHe nodded. \\n\\nI decided to ask if he’d seen the same stuff as me. \\n\\n“Have you ever been to the Southwest Wing?” I asked. \\n\\nHis smirk faded away. \\n\\n“What?” He said softly. \\n\\n“I guess not then. Ever heard of a guy who calls himself— the Sawbone?” \\n\\nHis facial expression got even darker. \\n\\n“I didn’t think he was still alive.” \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\nHe sat down in a chair across from mine. \\n\\n“Years ago, I,” he sighed, “I worked with Dr. O’Neil. Before he went insane.” \\n\\n“Really?” \\n\\n“Yeah. He was one of my buddies from school. When we graduated, he asked if I wanted to be part of a project. I accepted.” \\n\\n“I was eager to work on this with him. He described it as revolutionary.” \\n\\nI nodded. \\n\\n“When he brought in the volunteers, I got confused. I thought we were going to be researching prosthetics and stuff.” He sighed. \\n\\n“What happened?” \\n\\n“He started hacking them apart right in front of me, and he wouldn’t let me leave even though I was obviously uncomfortable. What he was doing was so— wrong.” \\n\\n“Wait— you’re my nephew.” I said, interrupting the conversation. \\n\\n“What?” \\n\\n“Nevermind. Back to your story.” \\n\\n“Okay— anyway, he was laughing maniacally the whole goddamn time. It was terrifying. He wasn’t the Brandon I used to know— I’d never seen this side of him.” \\n\\n“So what did you do?” \\n\\n“Nothing. He ended up blowing himself up in some crazy experiment.” \\n\\nMy eyes widened in shock. \\n\\n“I watched him die, Max.”\\n\\nThe room fell into an awkward silence, to the point where you could hear a pin drop. You know how in the movies, they have those scenes where the character reveals a big secret? It felt like one of those. \\n\\n“Well, he’s obviously still alive. Was there any way he could have survived?” \\n\\nMark shook his head solemnly. \\n\\n“No. There were pieces of him everywhere. There was no way.” \\n\\n“Intriguing. Well, I know I’m new to all this magic stuff, but— is there a way he could have— I dunno, been resurrected?” \\n\\nMark shrugged. \\n\\n“It would be extremely hard.” \\n\\n“I think we should tell Apollo.” I suggested. \\n\\nMark thought for a few seconds before agreeing with me. \\n\\nWe both stayed for night shift that night, and then ascended the spiral staircase to the fourth floor. Apollo’s floor. \\n\\nThe only thing was, Apollo was not there. \\n\\nI sighed. \\n\\n“Where is he?”\\n\\n“Maybe Olympus?” Mark gestured towards the staircase and pointed upward. \\n\\n“I really don’t want to climb all those,” I whined, “watch him not even be there.” \\n\\n“Even if he isn’t, there’s other helpful gods.” \\n\\n“Whatever. I guess it’s worth it if we do something about The Sawbone.” I sighed, beginning to climb the stairs. \\n\\nAbout an hour and 200 stairs later, we got off at the top of the staircase. \\n\\nThe landing was remarkably ornate and gorgeously designed, with marble and gold accenting every structure. I felt incredibly out of place. \\n\\nWe approached a set of large, gilded double doors, considering the fact that they were the only thing in sight that could be a possible entrance to Olympus.\\n\\nI knocked. \\n\\nThe doors opened.\\n\\nThe room widened into a grand hall, with 12 thrones lining the walls. \\n\\nEach throne was occupied by a god. \\n\\n“WHAT MORTAL DARES ENTER OLYMPUS?” A voice boomed. \\n\\nI waved. \\n\\n“Zeus, dude, chill out. It’s just my kid,” Apollo said, “and some other dude. What’s up?”\\n\\nWe explained the whole situation to him. \\n\\n“Unfortunately, Hephaestus isn’t here right now, so I’ll have to talk some sense into him.” \\n\\n“Alright.”\\n\\n“But I’ll need your help to find the wing.” \\n\\n“Ok.” \\n\\nWe made our way back down the staircase, discussing plans the whole time. \\n\\nI told Apollo and Mark about the labyrinth, and how the delta symbol marked the entrance. \\n\\n“Oh, so like this?” Mark said, picking a flyer off of a bulletin board. It was the same flyer I had found earlier, the one that was just a triangle. \\n\\n“That was easy.” Apollo said. \\n\\nAs soon as the wall disappeared, we began walking. \\n\\nThe wing had completely changed— almost as if it were alive, and actively trying to keep us from getting to our destination— if we even had one. \\n\\nWe were walking for a few minutes, when the corridor started getting— eerie.\\n\\nSomeone was following us. \\n\\n“Well, well, well, I see you’ve brought friends this time, Dr.” Growled a voice behind us\\n\\nGuess who? \\n\\nThe Sawbone spread his arms wide dramatically and sneered. \\n\\n“Brought more people to witness my talents? Or possibly more subjects?” \\n\\n“Your father is very disappointed in you.” Apollo said, crossing his muscular arms. \\n\\n“Why would he be disappointed? After all, he gave me my talents.” He smirked. \\n\\n“Ms. Wilson, I assume you enjoyed my show so much that you wanted to show it to your friends? Well, come on! Let’s have some fun.” \\n\\nHe glanced at Mark.\\n\\n“We’re gonna have a lot of fun.” \\n\\nHe led us down the hallway once again, \\n\\nEveryone was silent as we followed him, tuning out his despicable monologuing. I wondered if Apollo had a plan. \\n\\nHe probably didn’t. \\n\\nThe Sawbone led us further until we finally arrived at his “workshop.” \\n\\n“Ta dahhh!” He sang, showcasing the room to us as the doors opened. \\n\\n“Now darlings, just keep behind the yellow line. Ms. Wilson can advocate that it gets pretty messy.” He snickered.\\n\\nI started feeling sick again. \\n\\nThe Sawbone called for his assistant again, but this time is wasn’t a Minotaur. \\n\\nThe guy shuffled in uncomfortably, pushing the gurney with the “specimens.” \\n\\nThe Sawbone started laughing maniacally and asking for suggestions again. \\n\\nThen, faster than light, Apollo lunged towards the Sawbone and grabbed him by the neck. \\n\\n“You will not do this to mortals. Or anything, for that matter. I am the god Apollo, owner of this hospital, and I forbid it. You have done too much, and the Olympian Council has warranted for your arrest- dead or alive.” \\n\\nThe Sawbone smirked. \\n\\n“Yeah, right.” \\n\\nThen I watched in horror as Apollo snapped his neck. Effortlessly. \\n\\nI heard the sickening crunch, and the Sawbone crumpled to the floor, still wearing his devilish grin. \\n\\nHe was dead. \\n\\n“What—“ I began to ask. \\n\\nSuddenly, the Sawbone sat up.\\n\\nAnd his head swiveled around to look at us. \\n\\n“You didn’t think I’d modify myself too, foolish demigod?”',\n",

New to all the demigod stuff, eh?” He smirked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot more than that— what?” I asked him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I knew we had more in common than before. Allow me to reintroduce myself— Dr. Mark Smith, Son of Asclepius.” He held out his hand. I shook it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Pretty generic name for a son of such a specialized god.” I sniffed back my tears to smirk. I wasn’t surprised by his identity, I knew something was off about him since I met him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to ask if he’d seen the same stuff as me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever been to the Southwest Wing?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His smirk faded away. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” He said softly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I guess not then. Ever heard of a guy who calls himself— the Sawbone?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His facial expression got even darker. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think he was still alive.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He sat down in a chair across from mine. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Years ago, I,” he sighed, “I worked with Dr. O’Neil. Before he went insane.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Really?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. He was one of my buddies from school. When we graduated, he asked if I wanted to be part of a project. I accepted.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I was eager to work on this with him. He described it as revolutionary.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“When he brought in the volunteers, I got confused. I thought we were going to be researching prosthetics and stuff.” He sighed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What happened?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He started hacking them apart right in front of me, and he wouldn’t let me leave even though I was obviously uncomfortable. What he was doing was so— wrong.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait— you’re my nephew.” I said, interrupting the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nevermind. Back to your story.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay— anyway, he was laughing maniacally the whole goddamn time. It was terrifying. He wasn’t the Brandon I used to know— I’d never seen this side of him.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So what did you do?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Nothing. He ended up blowing himself up in some crazy experiment.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes widened in shock. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I watched him die, Max.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room fell into an awkward silence, to the point where you could hear a pin drop. You know how in the movies, they have those scenes where the character reveals a big secret? It felt like one of those. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, he’s obviously still alive. Was there any way he could have survived?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mark shook his head solemnly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No. There were pieces of him everywhere. There was no way.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Intriguing. Well, I know I’m new to all this magic stuff, but— is there a way he could have— I dunno, been resurrected?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mark shrugged. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It would be extremely hard.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we should tell Apollo.” I suggested. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mark thought for a few seconds before agreeing with me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We both stayed for night shift that night, and then ascended the spiral staircase to the fourth floor. Apollo’s floor. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing was, Apollo was not there. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where is he?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Maybe Olympus?” Mark gestured towards the staircase and pointed upward. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I really don’t want to climb all those,” I whined, “watch him not even be there.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Even if he isn’t, there’s other helpful gods.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Whatever. I guess it’s worth it if we do something about The Sawbone.” I sighed, beginning to climb the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About an hour and 200 stairs later, we got off at the top of the staircase. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The landing was remarkably ornate and gorgeously designed, with marble and gold accenting every structure. I felt incredibly out of place. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We approached a set of large, gilded double doors, considering the fact that they were the only thing in sight that could be a possible entrance to Olympus.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The doors opened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The room widened into a grand hall, with 12 thrones lining the walls. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each throne was occupied by a god. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“WHAT MORTAL DARES ENTER OLYMPUS?” A voice boomed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I waved. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Zeus, dude, chill out. It’s just my kid,” Apollo said, “and some other dude. What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We explained the whole situation to him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, Hephaestus isn’t here right now, so I’ll have to talk some sense into him.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Alright.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“But I’ll need your help to find the wing.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ok.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We made our way back down the staircase, discussing plans the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I told Apollo and Mark about the labyrinth, and how the delta symbol marked the entrance. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, so like this?” Mark said, picking a flyer off of a bulletin board. It was the same flyer I had found earlier, the one that was just a triangle. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That was easy.” Apollo said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as the wall disappeared, we began walking. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The wing had completely changed— almost as if it were alive, and actively trying to keep us from getting to our destination— if we even had one. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We were walking for a few minutes, when the corridor started getting— eerie.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Someone was following us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well, well, well, I see you’ve brought friends this time, Dr.” Growled a voice behind us&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guess who? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Sawbone spread his arms wide dramatically and sneered. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Brought more people to witness my talents? Or possibly more subjects?” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Your father is very disappointed in you.” Apollo said, crossing his muscular arms. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why would he be disappointed? After all, he gave me my talents.” He smirked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ms. Wilson, I assume you enjoyed my show so much that you wanted to show it to your friends? Well, come on! Let’s have some fun.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He glanced at Mark.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re gonna have a lot of fun.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He led us down the hallway once again, &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone was silent as we followed him, tuning out his despicable monologuing. I wondered if Apollo had a plan. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He probably didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Sawbone led us further until we finally arrived at his “workshop.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ta dahhh!” He sang, showcasing the room to us as the doors opened. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now darlings, just keep behind the yellow line. Ms. Wilson can advocate that it gets pretty messy.” He snickered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I started feeling sick again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Sawbone called for his assistant again, but this time is wasn’t a Minotaur. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The guy shuffled in uncomfortably, pushing the gurney with the “specimens.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Sawbone started laughing maniacally and asking for suggestions again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then, faster than light, Apollo lunged towards the Sawbone and grabbed him by the neck. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You will not do this to mortals. Or anything, for that matter. I am the god Apollo, owner of this hospital, and I forbid it. You have done too much, and the Olympian Council has warranted for your arrest- dead or alive.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Sawbone smirked. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, right.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then I watched in horror as Apollo snapped his neck. Effortlessly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I heard the sickening crunch, and the Sawbone crumpled to the floor, still wearing his devilish grin. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was dead. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What—“ I began to ask. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the Sawbone sat up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And his head swiveled around to look at us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t think I’d modify myself too, foolish demigod?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'My son vanished over seven days ago. I have not contacted authorities yet, because I think something much more sinister is going on.\\n\\nFirst, let me give you some background. My son is an aspiring author. He would share some of his stories with me when he was younger, but as he has aged he kept his stories more private. I found one of his journals a few months back and the things inside of it terrified me. I don’t know how my sweet boy could conjure such horrific ideas. I confronted him about his stories at dinner a few nights after finding his journal. A barrage of curse words were thrown out at me and he left storming off to his room. My husband just chopped it up to teenage hormones, but I knew at the time that something was not right. Call it a mothers instinct if you will.  \\n\\nWith my son increasing his privacy from me, I grew more interested in discovering his secrets. I am ashamed to admit it, but I stole his laptop from his room one night when he was sleeping. I searched through his internet history and found that he had been posting to this page almost nightly. All of his stories only managed to gain a few up-votes here and there, none were even close to making the main page. It seemed the more stories he posted the darker and more twisted they became. I brought this to my husbands attention who just dismissed the stories. He told me that our son was just going through an angsty phase and it would pass before we knew it. I could not bring myself to read anymore of my sons stories as they just chilled my bones.\\n\\nHowever, the night that my son disappeared I immediately went to his laptop to look for any kind of clues. I found that a week before he vanished he stopped posting stories on this page. Instead, his browser history consisted of demonic rituals and articles on possession. He appeared to be studying how to place his soul into inanimate objects. He has journals in his desk drawer that are just filled with entire languages that I cannot read and symbols I cannot understand. I asked my husband for help, but he was just as clueless as I am.\\n\\nMy husband did not even know what reddit was, so I showed him our son’s account and asked him to read the last story my son posted before disappearing. I could not bring myself to read another horrific story from my son. I regret asking this of my husband because, he began to act very different after reading. The night he read the story I woke up to him in bed just staring at me wide awake. I turned around and just closed my eyes until I fell back asleep. I asked him about it in the morning and he was confused. He said that he slept through the entire night. He called off work that day and stayed glued to his computer doing nothing but reading stories posted here. I made him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but he went without for each meal. I could not even get three words out of him the entire day. This went on for the next six days. I was petrified to go to sleep next to him in bed. His phone light just lighting up his face as he religiously scrolled through this page, reading every story posted.\\n\\nLast night I woke up to use the restroom. I was relieved when I did not immediately see him still awake next to me reading from his phone like he had been the past few nights. I walked into our bathroom and noticed that the floor was sticky. I glanced up and saw a shadow in the corner next to the toilet whispering incoherent words to himself. I flicked on the light and saw my husband. His stomach was covered in blood and a symbol was carved onto his chest. It was the same symbol I saw repeatedly drawn in my son’s notebook. It goes without saying I got the fuck out of that house.\\n\\nI ran to my car, still wearing my pajamas and immediately drove to my sisters house. I explained to her what was going on and she immediately tried to convince me to call the cops. I told her that it has been over a week since my sons disappearance and it will look bad that I didn’t report it sooner, but how can any one blame me, so much weird shit just happened in such a short amount of time. I showed her the posts from my phone that my son made before he disappeared to give her an idea of whats going on. I watched her eyes blacken and her skin turn to a ghoulish white. I tried to take my phone back from her but she bit my hand and ran off into her closet. Not taking any chances, I decided to lock the closet door behind her. I do not know how to proceed form here and desperately need help. \\n\\nMy son has been missing for seven days now, My husband is cut up in my bathroom, and now I have my sister trapped in her own closet with nothing but an iPhone. I know I need to call the police and explain what is going on. I know they will come and arrest me for sounding like a psychotic woman that lost her child, abused her husband, and trapped her sister in a closet, but before they do I need to warn everyone on this page. I am writing this from my sisters computer, being extra cautious to not read any of the newest stories that started trending on this page. I think my son put his soul into this sub-reddit and is able to possess anyone that reads his post. Please proceed with caution as he used many different usernames. His stories will grip you and terrorize you. You will know it’s him when you find yourself desperately hooked, staying up late just to finish the story.',\n",

I confronted him about his stories at dinner a few nights after finding his journal. A barrage of curse words were thrown out at me and he left storming off to his room. My husband just chopped it up to teenage hormones, but I knew at the time that something was not right. Call it a mothers instinct if you will.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With my son increasing his privacy from me, I grew more interested in discovering his secrets. I am ashamed to admit it, but I stole his laptop from his room one night when he was sleeping. I searched through his internet history and found that he had been posting to this page almost nightly. All of his stories only managed to gain a few up-votes here and there, none were even close to making the main page. It seemed the more stories he posted the darker and more twisted they became. I brought this to my husbands attention who just dismissed the stories. He told me that our son was just going through an angsty phase and it would pass before we knew it. I could not bring myself to read anymore of my sons stories as they just chilled my bones.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, the night that my son disappeared I immediately went to his laptop to look for any kind of clues. I found that a week before he vanished he stopped posting stories on this page. Instead, his browser history consisted of demonic rituals and articles on possession. He appeared to be studying how to place his soul into inanimate objects. He has journals in his desk drawer that are just filled with entire languages that I cannot read and symbols I cannot understand. I asked my husband for help, but he was just as clueless as I am.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My husband did not even know what reddit was, so I showed him our son’s account and asked him to read the last story my son posted before disappearing. I could not bring myself to read another horrific story from my son. I regret asking this of my husband because, he began to act very different after reading. The night he read the story I woke up to him in bed just staring at me wide awake. I turned around and just closed my eyes until I fell back asleep. I asked him about it in the morning and he was confused. He said that he slept through the entire night. He called off work that day and stayed glued to his computer doing nothing but reading stories posted here. I made him breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but he went without for each meal. I could not even get three words out of him the entire day. This went on for the next six days. I was petrified to go to sleep next to him in bed. His phone light just lighting up his face as he religiously scrolled through this page, reading every story posted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I woke up to use the restroom. I was relieved when I did not immediately see him still awake next to me reading from his phone like he had been the past few nights. I walked into our bathroom and noticed that the floor was sticky. I glanced up and saw a shadow in the corner next to the toilet whispering incoherent words to himself. I flicked on the light and saw my husband. His stomach was covered in blood and a symbol was carved onto his chest. It was the same symbol I saw repeatedly drawn in my son’s notebook. It goes without saying I got the fuck out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I ran to my car, still wearing my pajamas and immediately drove to my sisters house. I explained to her what was going on and she immediately tried to convince me to call the cops. I told her that it has been over a week since my sons disappearance and it will look bad that I didn’t report it sooner, but how can any one blame me, so much weird shit just happened in such a short amount of time. I showed her the posts from my phone that my son made before he disappeared to give her an idea of whats going on. I watched her eyes blacken and her skin turn to a ghoulish white. I tried to take my phone back from her but she bit my hand and ran off into her closet. Not taking any chances, I decided to lock the closet door behind her. I do not know how to proceed form here and desperately need help. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My son has been missing for seven days now, My husband is cut up in my bathroom, and now I have my sister trapped in her own closet with nothing but an iPhone. I know I need to call the police and explain what is going on. I know they will come and arrest me for sounding like a psychotic woman that lost her child, abused her husband, and trapped her sister in a closet, but before they do I need to warn everyone on this page. I am writing this from my sisters computer, being extra cautious to not read any of the newest stories that started trending on this page. I think my son put his soul into this sub-reddit and is able to possess anyone that reads his post. Please proceed with caution as he used many different usernames. His stories will grip you and terrorize you. You will know it’s him when you find yourself desperately hooked, staying up late just to finish the story.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

We just identified the ruined remains of our only child, after watching the video of her jum--” *Print chokes up*\\n\\n*Officer Smith clears his throat again*\\n\\n*Silence*\\n\\nMrs. Print: “She started working in \\'08 or \\'09, it\\'s all so jumbled up... It was her first job, she was so excited to be ‘saving lives.’ When she started the job she told me all about it, every day. She’d leave school, ride the bus to the center, and work for 4-5 hours a day. She described to me the calls she had. The first few months they weren’t too bad. My baby was happy, she felt she was making a difference. Then something happened.”\\n\\n**Officer Smith**: *Writing* *“What happened, ma’am?”*\\n\\nMr. Print: *scoffs* “A boy.”\\n\\nMrs. Print: “It wasn’t like that, John. It wasn’t.\\n\\n“She came home one day and told me she made a friend. The entire time she had worked there she mentioned only her callers, or praise from supervisors. She never mentioned any friends.\\n\\n“She was a bright girl. Madison was like sunshine. Everyone at school loved her, but she was also very nervous. I think maybe she didn’t try to make friends at the center.\\n\\n*But then there was [Danny](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bu3npq/thank_you_for_calling_the_brighter_futures/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share)*.”\\n\\n**Officer Smith: “Who is Danny?”**\\n\\nMr. Print: “Daniel Albright. Some guy my Maddy worked with.”\\n\\nMrs. Print: “They weren’t romantic. She would have told me. She worked with him for months. He was a hard worker, but he was a little weird. We never got to meet him.”\\n\\nMr. Print: “That’s why I think there was more to it….”\\n\\nMrs. Print: “Anyway, she started coming home with less stories about work and her callers and her saved lives and more about Danny. Danny this, Danny that. They got along, worked the same shifts for a while. She was happy.\\n\\n“My Madison was always happy. She always saw the good in everyone and everything. That’s why this just makes no sense--” *Mrs. Print breaks down into tears*\\n\\nMr. Print: “Danny was the subject of all their talks before long. Madison went to work. She stayed late, she had lunch with this boy. They started getting awards from work. She had already been trained but she mentioned Danny ‘showing her the way.’\\n\\nOne day, Madison doesn’t come home with a story about this Danny dude. Instead it was about a Nomi. She changed after that call. Said she knew what was happening, whatever that means. She wasn’t the same after that, she didn’t come home with any stories anymore. It took us months, literal months, before we could get her to talk.\\n\\nShe said that Danny had killed himself. She said it was in some awful way that deeply affected everyone on their shift, even the people who thought Danny was weird and strange.\\n\\nShe was different after Danny’s death. And that’s also why I think he was dating her, or dragging her into something weird! She wasn’t our little Sunshine anymore. She wasn’t anyone’s sunshine... She graduated and lost her way, stopped talking about college and the future.\\n\\nShe was supposed to be seeing some counselor at work. Why does a call center need hired counselors?! Whoever she was seeing, they didn’t help. She was still lost. She even quit the center for a while. She stayed at home in her room for months.\\n\\nShe decided to go back randomly… They let her. She worked crazy hours and didn’t tell us stories anymore. She didn’t tell us anything.\\n\\nWe lost her to that place. Something damaged her there, something more than Danny, and she stayed damaged until* *that* *day. Then she...then she did what she… Fuck!”\\n\\n**The conversation fell off as Mrs. Print fell into hysterics and Mr. Print fell into a rage. It was clear from what they repeated through the rest of the interview that the Prints had no idea how to find closure, that they weren’t ready. Madison’s parents were heartbroken and lost and trying to find someone to blame.**\\n\\n**The police gained a special interest in Daniel Albright. They went to Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline to look over Madison’s last week. They also pulled the last two phone calls she ever made-- both to BFSH.**\\n\\n**Below are the transcripts of the calls that Madison, a new trainer at BFSH, was “reviewing.”  The calls she reviewed were all calls taken by Daniel Albright in ‘09; they might have changed it all for Madison Print after so many years of working at BFSH.**\\n\\n*March --, 2009*\\n\\n**Daniel Albright: “Hello, welcome to the Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline. We’re here today to help you make it through tomorrow. My name is Danny, how can I help you today?”**\\n\\nCaller: “Hi. Y-yes. Um…”\\n\\n**Daniel: “Take your time, I am here to listen.”**\\n\\n*Silence*\\n\\nCaller: *muffled murmuring*\\n\\n**Daniel: “Ma’am, are you thinking of hurting yourself?”**\\n\\n*Silence*\\n\\n*Sniffling*\\n\\nCaller: “Are these calls private?”\\n\\n**Daniel: “We are here to help. We are here to listen. Are you safe?”**\\n\\nCaller: “I… I am now. I’m just thinking about...about ending it all.”\\n\\n**Daniel: “You’re not alone in thinking this way. It is common, but we are here to help. Do you have a name you’d prefer I’d call you, ma’am?”**\\n\\nCaller: “No! No names.”\\n\\n**Daniel: “Alright, no problem. Plenty of people in crisis don’t wish to share their personal information. Ma’am, can you share why you’re thinking about ending it all?”**\\n\\n*Crackling on the other line*\\n\\n*Bring us more.*\\n\\n**Daniel: “...Ma’am?”**\\n\\n*You can’t stop it.*\\n\\n**Daniel: “Caller, have you taken anything that may have put you in an unsafe situation?”**\\n\\nCaller: *clearly*: “I can’t take it anymore. The guilt. It’s physically painful.”*\\n\\n**Daniel: “Many of us struggle with guilt daily, how may I help you alleviate your guilt?”**\\n\\nCaller: “I’m alone in this struggle. There is no way anyone has done something this...this horrible. There’s no way that anyone has felt guilty over the evil things I’ve done.”\\n\\n**Daniel: “I’m listening, ma’am. Your story is important.”**\\n\\nCaller: “I-- um. I did something evil. It was a few months ago, and I can’t take it anymore… I was driving, maybe even just the slightest bit intoxicated, just a little.\\n\\n“Don’t judge me for that. I know I’m not alone in* **that** decision, at least.”\\n\\n**Daniel: “I’m not here to judge. I’m here to help.”**\\n\\nCaller: “I can’t be helped. And she couldn’t be helped. Her baby couldn’t have been helped, either.”\\n\\n*There is proof that Daniel attempted to triangulate the caller’s location*\\n\\n“I hit her square in the middle. She went flying. Not before I saw how big her fuckin’ stomach was. Not before I saw the fear in her face. There was blood everywhere. Pooling out from her head… from between her legs…”\\n\\n“I’m not a fuckin’ doctor, okay Daniel? I’m not a fuckin’ doctor, and I wasn’t a murderer before that night. But I am now. I’m a killer now. I killed two innocents. I’ll never forgive myself.\\n\\n“I can’t forget what I did. I won’t forgive what I did. Did you see the news article? They called the person who hit her an animal. They said it was her first baby, that it was a little girl. They said the kid could have been saved.\\n\\n“I didn’t stop though.”\\n\\n*Shaky breaths, quiet crying from caller*\\n\\n“I didn’t stop because I was more than a little intoxicated and there was so much blood and I was so scared.\\n\\n“Now I’m just guilty. But not for long. Thanks for listening, Daniel.”\\n\\n**Daniel: “Ma’am, wait--”**\\n\\n*static*\\n\\n*Bring us the fetus*\\n\\n*click*\\n\\n**In the notebook that Madison kept at her desk we found hundreds of notes on Daniel Albright’s call logs. This is how the police and Angie Rice managed to listen to the calls that Madison last reviewed.**\\n\\n**The above transcribed call had more notes on it than any other call (some of the notes were written in a strange language we have yet to decipher). Madison’s notes helped investigators realize that there was a ***third*** voice on the call (the voice on this call was listed as a “Nomi,” a name that was apparently known to Daniel but in the notes Madison is confused because she never knew a Nomi to work at the center). This led to the discovery that there was a third voice with threatening and strange messages/warnings in ***most*** of Daniel Albright’s calls recorded in 2009.**\\n\\n**Investigators also discovered that when Madison applied for BFSH, she had been impregnated by an unknown man. Her notes hint at the events leading to her pregnancy being nonconsensual. In an attempt to self-abort, Madison accidently overdosed. She was found by an unnamed trusted friend, driven to the closest hospital, and resuscitated.**\\n\\n**Her notebook after listening to the above call is filled with notes on her guilt and her pain. Madison lived two lives before and after she worked at BFSH: the “sunshine” Maddy known by her family and her friends, and the lonely, guilt-ridden Madison Print known at work.**\\n\\n**Investigators believe this call, and the clear mental breakdown that Madison suffered on the job after listening to it, may have been a leading factor in her death.**\\n\\n**Police released the final two calls that Madison Print made after public outcry over her highly broadcasted suicide. The transcription of both calls with Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline employee,** [Regina](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/byu4sp/no_one_is_nominated_employee_of_the_month_at/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=control_1)**\"Gina\" Harte, can be found below.**\\n\\n**Gina: “Hi there! Welcome to Brighter Futures Suicide Prevention Hotline. We are here today to help you make it through tomorrow. How can I help you today?”**\\n\\nMadison: “I’m not sure why I’m calling. I know how this goes.”\\n\\n**Gina: “You’re calling because you want someone to listen to you. That’s what I am here for. May I call you by your name?”**\\n\\nMadison: “People call me, ‘M’. That’ll do, I guess.”\\n\\n**Gina: “Alright, M. You’re calling today because you want some help. We’ve all been in positions where we need help. How can I help you today?”**\\n\\nMadison: *laughs*\\n\\n**Gina: “M, are you safe right now?”**\\n\\nMadison: *Laughs*\\n\\n*Faintly - Bring us more.*\\n\\n*Gina attempts triangulation of caller’s location*\\n\\n**Gina: “M, can you tell me where you are? If you’re safe?”**\\n\\nMadison: “I am on top of a very, very tall building.”\\n\\n**Gina: “M, have you taken anything? Are you in danger?”**\\n\\nMadison: “Yes.”\\n\\n*Call disconnects*\\n\\n**Madison called back ten minutes later. Gina answered her call again. This would be the last call that Madison made before plummeting to her death.**\\n\\n**Gina: “Welcome to Brighter Futures--”***\\n\\nMadison: “Stop.”\\n\\n**Gina: “M, is that you?”**\\n\\nMadison: “You can’t stop it, Gina. I know what you’ve done.”\\n\\n**Gina: “M, where are you? Are you still unsafe?”**\\n\\nMadison: *Laughs*\\n\\n*Bring us more.*\\n\\n**Gina: “M, we are here to help. We’re here to listen. I want to help you see tomorrow!”**\\n\\nMadison: “You can’t stop it, Gina.”\\n\\n*Click*\\n\\n**When Gina was interviewed by the police and by Angie Rice in the days following Madison Print’s tragic death, Gina told everyone the same thing.**\\n\\n**“I never told that girl my name.”**',\n",

I think we’ve got it all straight, but we like to make sure in cases like these.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “What, suicides?” &lt;em&gt;She laughs brokenly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith: “Yes, ma’am. Your daughter, Madison, she was 24?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “She would have turned 25 in June.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith:&lt;/strong&gt; “I want to apologize again for your loss. I can’t imagine losing someone so young.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “Losing our ONLY child so young.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smith clears throat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith: “Madison was working at...&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c23i4c/you_hear_all_the_gossip_while_working_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x\"&gt;Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “On and off for about nine years now...then…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “That place is what did this!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;“What do you mean, ma’am?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: &lt;em&gt;growing hysterical&lt;/em&gt; “That place made her kill herself! It changed her.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith: “Tell me what you can about that.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “Honey, we don’t have to go over this again--”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “I want to!” &lt;em&gt;Crying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “Excuse us. We just identified the ruined remains of our only child, after watching the video of her jum--” &lt;em&gt;Print chokes up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Officer Smith clears his throat again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “She started working in &amp;#39;08 or &amp;#39;09, it&amp;#39;s all so jumbled up... It was her first job, she was so excited to be ‘saving lives.’ When she started the job she told me all about it, every day. She’d leave school, ride the bus to the center, and work for 4-5 hours a day. She described to me the calls she had. The first few months they weren’t too bad. My baby was happy, she felt she was making a difference. Then something happened.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Writing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“What happened, ma’am?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: &lt;em&gt;scoffs&lt;/em&gt; “A boy.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “It wasn’t like that, John. It wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She came home one day and told me she made a friend. The entire time she had worked there she mentioned only her callers, or praise from supervisors. She never mentioned any friends.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“She was a bright girl. Madison was like sunshine. Everyone at school loved her, but she was also very nervous. I think maybe she didn’t try to make friends at the center.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But then there was &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bu3npq/thank_you_for_calling_the_brighter_futures/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Danny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officer Smith: “Who is Danny?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “Daniel Albright. Some guy my Maddy worked with.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “They weren’t romantic. She would have told me. She worked with him for months. He was a hard worker, but he was a little weird. We never got to meet him.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “That’s why I think there was more to it….”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Print: “Anyway, she started coming home with less stories about work and her callers and her saved lives and more about Danny. Danny this, Danny that. They got along, worked the same shifts for a while. She was happy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“My Madison was always happy. She always saw the good in everyone and everything. That’s why this just makes no sense--” &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Print breaks down into tears&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Print: “Danny was the subject of all their talks before long. Madison went to work. She stayed late, she had lunch with this boy. They started getting awards from work. She had already been trained but she mentioned Danny ‘showing her the way.’&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One day, Madison doesn’t come home with a story about this Danny dude. Instead it was about a Nomi. She changed after that call. Said she knew what was happening, whatever that means. She wasn’t the same after that, she didn’t come home with any stories anymore. It took us months, literal months, before we could get her to talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said that Danny had killed himself. She said it was in some awful way that deeply affected everyone on their shift, even the people who thought Danny was weird and strange.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was different after Danny’s death. And that’s also why I think he was dating her, or dragging her into something weird! She wasn’t our little Sunshine anymore. She wasn’t anyone’s sunshine... She graduated and lost her way, stopped talking about college and the future.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She was supposed to be seeing some counselor at work. Why does a call center need hired counselors?! Whoever she was seeing, they didn’t help. She was still lost. She even quit the center for a while. She stayed at home in her room for months.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She decided to go back randomly… They let her. She worked crazy hours and didn’t tell us stories anymore. She didn’t tell us anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We lost her to that place. Something damaged her there, something more than Danny, and she stayed damaged until* &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; *day. Then she...then she did what she… Fuck!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conversation fell off as Mrs. Print fell into hysterics and Mr. Print fell into a rage. It was clear from what they repeated through the rest of the interview that the Prints had no idea how to find closure, that they weren’t ready. Madison’s parents were heartbroken and lost and trying to find someone to blame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The police gained a special interest in Daniel Albright. They went to Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline to look over Madison’s last week. They also pulled the last two phone calls she ever made-- both to BFSH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are the transcripts of the calls that Madison, a new trainer at BFSH, was “reviewing.”  The calls she reviewed were all calls taken by Daniel Albright in ‘09; they might have changed it all for Madison Print after so many years of working at BFSH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;March --, 2009&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Albright: “Hello, welcome to the Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline. We’re here today to help you make it through tomorrow. My name is Danny, how can I help you today?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “Hi. Y-yes. Um…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Take your time, I am here to listen.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: &lt;em&gt;muffled murmuring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Ma’am, are you thinking of hurting yourself?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sniffling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “Are these calls private?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “We are here to help. We are here to listen. Are you safe?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “I… I am now. I’m just thinking about...about ending it all.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “You’re not alone in thinking this way. It is common, but we are here to help. Do you have a name you’d prefer I’d call you, ma’am?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “No! No names.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Alright, no problem. Plenty of people in crisis don’t wish to share their personal information. Ma’am, can you share why you’re thinking about ending it all?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crackling on the other line&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring us more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “...Ma’am?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t stop it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Caller, have you taken anything that may have put you in an unsafe situation?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt;: “I can’t take it anymore. The guilt. It’s physically painful.”*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Many of us struggle with guilt daily, how may I help you alleviate your guilt?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “I’m alone in this struggle. There is no way anyone has done something this...this horrible. There’s no way that anyone has felt guilty over the evil things I’ve done.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “I’m listening, ma’am. Your story is important.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “I-- um. I did something evil. It was a few months ago, and I can’t take it anymore… I was driving, maybe even just the slightest bit intoxicated, just a little.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t judge me for that. I know I’m not alone in* &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; decision, at least.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “I’m not here to judge. I’m here to help.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: “I can’t be helped. And she couldn’t be helped. Her baby couldn’t have been helped, either.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is proof that Daniel attempted to triangulate the caller’s location&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I hit her square in the middle. She went flying. Not before I saw how big her fuckin’ stomach was. Not before I saw the fear in her face. There was blood everywhere. Pooling out from her head… from between her legs…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a fuckin’ doctor, okay Daniel? I’m not a fuckin’ doctor, and I wasn’t a murderer before that night. But I am now. I’m a killer now. I killed two innocents. I’ll never forgive myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I can’t forget what I did. I won’t forgive what I did. Did you see the news article? They called the person who hit her an animal. They said it was her first baby, that it was a little girl. They said the kid could have been saved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t stop though.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaky breaths, quiet crying from caller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t stop because I was more than a little intoxicated and there was so much blood and I was so scared.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now I’m just guilty. But not for long. Thanks for listening, Daniel.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel: “Ma’am, wait--”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring us the fetus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the notebook that Madison kept at her desk we found hundreds of notes on Daniel Albright’s call logs. This is how the police and Angie Rice managed to listen to the calls that Madison last reviewed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The above transcribed call had more notes on it than any other call (some of the notes were written in a strange language we have yet to decipher). Madison’s notes helped investigators realize that there was a ***third&lt;/strong&gt;* voice on the call (the voice on this call was listed as a “Nomi,” a name that was apparently known to Daniel but in the notes Madison is confused because she never knew a Nomi to work at the center). This led to the discovery that there was a third voice with threatening and strange messages/warnings in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of Daniel Albright’s calls recorded in 2009.**&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigators also discovered that when Madison applied for BFSH, she had been impregnated by an unknown man. Her notes hint at the events leading to her pregnancy being nonconsensual. In an attempt to self-abort, Madison accidently overdosed. She was found by an unnamed trusted friend, driven to the closest hospital, and resuscitated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her notebook after listening to the above call is filled with notes on her guilt and her pain. Madison lived two lives before and after she worked at BFSH: the “sunshine” Maddy known by her family and her friends, and the lonely, guilt-ridden Madison Print known at work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigators believe this call, and the clear mental breakdown that Madison suffered on the job after listening to it, may have been a leading factor in her death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police released the final two calls that Madison Print made after public outcry over her highly broadcasted suicide. The transcription of both calls with Brighter Futures Suicide Hotline employee,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/byu4sp/no_one_is_nominated_employee_of_the_month_at/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_term=control_1\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Gina&amp;quot; Harte, can be found below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “Hi there! Welcome to Brighter Futures Suicide Prevention Hotline. We are here today to help you make it through tomorrow. How can I help you today?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “I’m not sure why I’m calling. I know how this goes.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “You’re calling because you want someone to listen to you. That’s what I am here for. May I call you by your name?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “People call me, ‘M’. That’ll do, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “Alright, M. You’re calling today because you want some help. We’ve all been in positions where we need help. How can I help you today?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: &lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, are you safe right now?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: &lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faintly - Bring us more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gina attempts triangulation of caller’s location&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, can you tell me where you are? If you’re safe?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “I am on top of a very, very tall building.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, have you taken anything? Are you in danger?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call disconnects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madison called back ten minutes later. Gina answered her call again. This would be the last call that Madison made before plummeting to her death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “Welcome to Brighter Futures--”&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “Stop.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, is that you?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: “You can’t stop it, Gina. I know what you’ve done.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, where are you? Are you still unsafe?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Madison: &lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring us more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina: “M, we are here to help.

       "   'selftext': 'Thanks to everyone that supported my last post and helped me in my search for any other “survivors”. If you haven’t read my last post, go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c2avue/the_world_ended_last_night_and_nobody_remembers/). And for the people that were concerned for my wellbeing, no, I did not overdose. I lost a friend to suicide and would never dream of inflicting that kind of pain on anyone I love.  Last night, somebody from a throwaway account messaged me. They said they remembered.\\n\\nThrowaway5483619: I saw your post. I know what you’re talking about, I remember every second of it.\\n\\nMe: Wait, really? I can’t tell you how much of a relief that is to hear. What’s your name?\\n\\nThrowaway5483619: Meet me at Nyx Café, 542 \\\\[redacted\\\\] St.\\n\\nMe: Can’t you tell me anything else?\\n\\nThrowaway5483619: It’s not safe. Meet me there, at 11 am. I’ll be in the back booth.\\n\\nAfter that cryptic message, they logged off. Despite my brain warning me against it, I went to the café. I just couldn’t turn down the opportunity to meet someone else that *knew*. The café wasn’t one that I had heard of before, although that doesn’t mean much in California. The streets are swarmed with obscure coffee shops. This one stood out from the others, however.\\n\\nA sign read “Nyx Café, Coffeeshop and Lounge”. I wasn’t sure what type of people came here to sit around and drink lattes, but it wasn’t anyone I messed around with. The walls were a dark brown brick, the color of dirt, contrasting against the pastel and colorful shops nearby. The door was a thick, wooden door with a small pane of glass at the top so you could see in. However, I’m only five foot so I had a hard time looking in. I opened the heavy door after a few seconds of struggling and entered the shop.\\n\\nThe windows were small, barely letting any light into the musty shop. It was a dark place, as one would assume. I walked around looking for anyone in the back booth, and quickly spotted a figure hunched over the table. They were dressed in a ratty black hoodie, fitting all the stereotypes for ‘internet creep’. Cautiously, I approached the table and sat opposite of them.\\n\\n“Um hi, are you the person that messaged me?” I was more than a little freaked out at this abnormal situation, so I tried to stay in the safe zone. I sat close to the edge of the seat, ready to bolt if something went wrong or they tried to kidnap me.\\n\\nThe person at the table sat up where I could get a good look at them. It was a young girl, maybe 17, dressed in all black. She had short brown hair that rested on her shoulders perfectly, and the most vivid green eyes I’ve ever seen. She looked like the type of girl that would have everyone’s attention whenever she walked into a room. She was just an attention-grabber. I later learned that her name is Emma.\\n\\n“Yes, I was. I remember the… events from the other day. I was just hanging out with my friends in my room, listening to music and talking, ya know, the usual stuff. Then it got really dark out and the music started looping, my friends started screaming…” She trailed off and shuddered.\\n\\n“I’m sorry that happened to you, at least I was home alone. How did you remember?” I asked. I knew that I remembered due to the injury on my hand, but other than that…\\n\\n“Well, I thought I was a dream but then I saw the scratch marks on my floor and knew it was real.” She started at the table’s dim surface, not seeing at all. She seemed like she was seriously traumatized. I felt for the girl, who knows what she went through that last night…\\n\\nI told her my story and we began trying to find similarities in our stories, but we only identified two as of this post being uploaded. Both of our houses were cleaned spotless of any evidence except for a tiny detail that had been overlooked. My palm, the scratches on her bedroom floor. And both of our memories show someone attempting to enter the house, then cut scene to the next morning.\\n\\nNow, why we are some of the only people to remember, we have no clue. But some people on that last post talk about vague memories of odd events or a pitch black sky that night. For whatever reason, the person or thing that caused that, apocalypse, wanted to wipe everyone’s memories of it. Emma and I seem to have been missed, or they just *couldn’t* erase the memory. I think that our ability to remember is linked to a painful or traumatic experience that happened that day. I sliced my hand open, and I don’t know what happened to Emma, but those scratches on her floor leave her troubled and out of it. I want to question her about it, but I fear stirring up any bad memories for her.\\n\\nEmma’s theory is that some extraterrestrial being was behind the infection and that they were ‘test running’ a sickness to completely eviscerate the human population. She doesn’t really elaborate past that, just that she thinks that we were the only survivors of the wipe out, and that’s why we remember. The infection didn’t kill *everyone*, or work as fast as they would like, so they removed the memories of everyone affected in an attempt for a ‘Round 2’.\\n\\nI choose not to believe any particular theory, but Emma’s path does seem to make sense. However sci-fi it may seem, the world ended. Then some*thing* reset it, and we’re the only ones who remember. I’m hoping that maybe someone else remembers what happened, someone my last post didn’t reach, and that they see this one. I don’t want Emma and I to be alone in this.\\n\\nEmma just told me that she found a website on the Dark Web for people that remember the, as the website said, “bloody deaths that took place on June 17th”. She wants to try to message the people at the website, but I’m not so sure that that’s a good idea.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone that supported my last post and helped me in my search for any other “survivors”. If you haven’t read my last post, go &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c2avue/the_world_ended_last_night_and_nobody_remembers/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And for the people that were concerned for my wellbeing, no, I did not overdose. I lost a friend to suicide and would never dream of inflicting that kind of pain on anyone I love.  Last night, somebody from a throwaway account messaged me. They said they remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Throwaway5483619: I saw your post. I know what you’re talking about, I remember every second of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Wait, really? I can’t tell you how much of a relief that is to hear. What’s your name?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Throwaway5483619: Meet me at Nyx Café, 542 [redacted] St.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Can’t you tell me anything else?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Throwaway5483619: It’s not safe. Meet me there, at 11 am. I’ll be in the back booth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After that cryptic message, they logged off. Despite my brain warning me against it, I went to the café. I just couldn’t turn down the opportunity to meet someone else that &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;. The café wasn’t one that I had heard of before, although that doesn’t mean much in California. The streets are swarmed with obscure coffee shops. This one stood out from the others, however.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A sign read “Nyx Café, Coffeeshop and Lounge”. I wasn’t sure what type of people came here to sit around and drink lattes, but it wasn’t anyone I messed around with. The walls were a dark brown brick, the color of dirt, contrasting against the pastel and colorful shops nearby. The door was a thick, wooden door with a small pane of glass at the top so you could see in. However, I’m only five foot so I had a hard time looking in. I opened the heavy door after a few seconds of struggling and entered the shop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The windows were small, barely letting any light into the musty shop. It was a dark place, as one would assume. I walked around looking for anyone in the back booth, and quickly spotted a figure hunched over the table. They were dressed in a ratty black hoodie, fitting all the stereotypes for ‘internet creep’. Cautiously, I approached the table and sat opposite of them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Um hi, are you the person that messaged me?” I was more than a little freaked out at this abnormal situation, so I tried to stay in the safe zone. I sat close to the edge of the seat, ready to bolt if something went wrong or they tried to kidnap me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The person at the table sat up where I could get a good look at them. It was a young girl, maybe 17, dressed in all black. She had short brown hair that rested on her shoulders perfectly, and the most vivid green eyes I’ve ever seen.

       "   'selftext': 'Sometimes it feels good to be sad. We may not admit it to ourselves or anyone else, but wallowing in self-pity while listening to some sad, old country song can feel pretty good sometimes. Especially when you’ve had a little to drink. Last night I decided I could use a lot to drink with a guitar crying in the background while I beat myself up for a while.\\n\\nWhy was I feeling like this? Well, a few weeks ago my girl left me. We spent what I thought were three perfect years together, but I guess she had just about enough of me. We graduated from Tech about a year ago. Her degree was in biology. Mine was in poly sci. We met in a philosophy class sophomore year. One day, she caught me staring while the professor spoke about people on train tracks getting slaughtered by trolleys or drowning children. I can’t remember honestly. Probably why I got a C.\\n\\nShe had dreams of ol’ Big D and a cute, picturesque life fit for Instagram. I had, well, dreams of jack shit and that was part of her problem with me. To quote Mac Davis, I guess happiness was Lubbock, Texas in her rear view mirror. For me, happiness was another season of Saturdays at the Jones and a few dozen more nights stumbling on the bricks of Broadway. Staying here was just fine with me, but after last night I need to be as far away from this place as possible.\\n\\nAfter work, I went home and got right to drinking. I should’ve went to the gym or cleaned the house or done literally anything other than cracking open a cold one. It seems to be my favorite pass time these days though. I took the top off of a Shiner and sank into the couch.\\n\\n“Hey Google, play some Merle Haggard.”\\n\\n“Playing Merle Haggard on Google Play Music.” The sweet, synthetic voice of Google Home replied.\\n\\nI took out my phone to mindlessly scroll on Facebook. Picture of a couple at a concert, NY Times article about escalating tensions with Iran, a Trump quote that would’ve surprised me a few years ago, wedding photo, shooting in Dallas.\\n\\n*Fuck this.* I thought to myself after realizing for the thousandth time that social media would just suck what little happiness I had right out of me.\\n\\nI set my phone on the coffee table and picked up my roommate’s animal science text book. Flipping through the pages, I wondered what Ashley was doing.\\n\\n*Probably already with somebody new.*\\n\\n“Some species of birds have their songs encoded in their DNA. Evolution saw to it that these species could instinctually attract mates and ward off other males.” I read aloud from the textbook.\\n\\n*Must be nice.* I tossed the book on the coffee table and took a few pulls from my second beer of the evening. I felt myself drifting off thinking of Ashley and her perfect life in the metroplex.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*…no woman gonna’ change the way I think. I think I’ll just stay here and drink.*\\n\\nI awoke to Merle’s voice and an upbeat piano tune. My watch said it was 11:59. I checked the fridge and there was only two beers left.\\n\\n*I think I’ll just stay here and drink.*\\n\\n\\\\*“\\\\*I don’t think so Merle. I’d rather be alone surrounded by other people.”\\n\\nIt being the witching hour, I couldn’t buy beer anywhere besides from a bootlegger. I don’t know any of those, so I decided I’d go listen to some no name artist at the Blue Light. With a couple sprays of cologne and a fresh pearl snap shirt, I headed out the door.\\n\\nI arrived around 12:20 giving me a solid hour or so to get properly fucked up and Uber home. The place was as empty as you’d imagine on a Tuesday night, but sometimes you’d be surprised by the crowd in the Depot on a weekday. I was certain I’d find some kind of trouble to get into even with an empty bar.\\n\\nThere was a couple dancing on the hardwood floor and people scattered on stools throughout the bar. I sat down and ordered a Shiner. The bartender struck up conversation with me probably figuring I could use the company. We talked a bit about various topics. William Clark Green had been in the night before and played a few songs. The new football coach was apparently a hard ass and Pat Mahomes was slowly making the Chiefs a team the bartender could “actually give a fuck about.” The conversation eventually dissolved into talking about tornadoes and I was reaching my limit with the small talk.\\n\\n“Can I get a shot of silver tequila, chilled and dressed?”\\n\\n“Sure thing bud.”\\n\\n“Oh, and another Shiner please.”\\n\\n“Gotcha’.”\\n\\nI looked down the bar at a pretty blonde woman. She was older than me and dressed like she was about a decade removed from undergrad. A giant rock sat on her left ring finger gleaming in the neon. She was sitting all alone, so maybe she wasn’t too happy with the home life. Just as I had that thought, a monster of a man walked out of the bathroom and sat on the stool next to her.\\n\\n“Not a lot of girls in here tonight, huh?.”\\n\\n“No, sir.” He laughed while setting my shot down. “You’ll have to come back Friday.”\\n\\nI licked the salt off the rim, downed the shot, and bit the lime to ease the bite. “Yeah, maybe I’ll see you then.”\\n\\nI pulled out my phone and opened Tinder—a favorite time killer when I was a few drinks deep. A brunette Tri Delt who looked like fun. *Yep.* A blonde with tattoos and a couple kids. *Fuck it. Yep.* Another blonde with a camo hat. “Looking for a man with a truck who’s six feet…” *Nope.*\\n\\nI swiped through a few more profiles before coming to a beautiful, black haired girl sitting on a black bed biting her finger. She was fair skinned and more gorgeous than any woman two-stepping on the dancefloor behind me. Her name was Luna and her eyes were black as night. They had a sadness to them. Maybe I thought she was like me and looking for someone to take the place of some far off ex-lover. A painting of the Moon hung on the wall behind her and flowers adorned the room. I swiped right. I sipped on my beer and swiped for a few more minutes until the app stuttered and granted me with a notification that I matched with Luna.\\n\\n*Well shit.*\\n\\nI didn’t think that would happen, but now I wish it hadn’t. I finished my beer while my phone chimed. “Luna messaged you!”\\n\\nI opened the message. It said, “Hey!” and had a winky face next to it.\\n\\n*Oh, great.*\\n\\nIn my experience, a message like that from a girl that hot with only one picture had to be a hooker, a man, or a Nigerian prince looking to give me some of his fortune.\\n\\nAnother message popped up. “You’re very handsome. You should text me.”\\n\\nThe phone number had a local area code and she didn’t speak broken English. Maybe this was a real one. I decided to take my chances.\\n\\n“Thank you. You’re gorgeous. “\\n\\nI replied and we texted back and forth while I drank a few more beers. We talked about her ex and my ex and what we were doing in life. Definitely not a Nigerian prince. Could still be a man, a hooker, or both. I was willing to find out.\\n\\nLuna finally sent a text that said, “Wanna’ come over?”\\n\\nI’m no stranger to bad decisions and decided to make another one.\\n\\n“Sure. What’s your address?”\\n\\nHer place was conveniently close. Less than a ten minute drive according to my phone.\\n\\n“Hey boss, can I close out?”\\n\\nThe bartender nodded and fetched my card. I left a tip reflective of my suddenly chipper mood and danced right out the door. I popped the collar on my jacket and pulled out a cigarette. Three drunk girls were yelling nonsense across the street and one fell down laughing, dragging one of the others down with her. I smiled with the corner of my mouth and lit the cigarette. I took a deep drag and blew it out looking over my shoulder at the lonely place I just left. I had a feeling it was going to be a good night. I’ve never been more wrong.\\n\\nIn the car I inputted Luna’s address and headed that way. I was probably over the limit, but it was the last thing on my mind at the time. I turned onto Texas Ave. and stopped at a red light. “Hey Siri, play Midland.” I sang along in an ignorantly giddy mood. The music would fade out as Siri offered directions periodically. “Put the Hurt on Me” played for most of the short drive. I pulled up to a leaning, grey building to the sound of a woozy electric guitar and sad lyrics.\\n\\n*Kill me softly baby with your kiss. If I go, I wanna’ go like this.*\\n\\nI shut the car off and walked up to the doors. I buzzed apartment number 237.\\n\\n*Hello?*\\n\\n“Hey, it’s me.”\\n\\n*Oh sweet! Come up!*\\n\\nThe door clicked and it let me through. There was no one in the lobby of the building. The elevator was out of order. After taking the stairs, I entered a hallway with flickering lights. I was already anxious about who was going to be on the other side of this apartment door and the horror movie shit wasn’t helping. On the door hung a little moon that looked like it came from Etsy. That made me feel a little better since it was consistent with the name and room decorations from her profile. I knocked.\\n\\nA stunning, dark haired woman opened the door. The Nigerian prince and man scenarios were out. Still could’ve been a hooker, but I was pretty sure they didn’t work from home. Her eyes weren’t black at all. They were a hauntingly beautiful greyish blue. The picture didn’t do her justice. I couldn’t believe this woman was really standing in front of me. I couldn’t even speak. I tried saying, “Hey!” but it didn’t come out.\\n\\n“Hi.” Her voice was incredibly pretty and came from the most beautiful lips I’d ever seen. I was already hearing wedding bells.\\n\\n“Hi.” Something finally came out of my mouth.\\n\\n“So do you want to come in?” She laughed.\\n\\n“Yeah, sorry.” I laughed too, but much more nervously.\\n\\nHer apartment was nice. It wasn’t at all indicative of the exterior of the shabby building I entered a few minutes prior.\\n\\n“I like your apartment.”\\n\\n“Thanks! I’ve only been here a few months. I like it a lot.” She walked into the kitchen connected to the living room. “Do you want something to drink? I have wine, beer, and a bottle of whiskey.”\\n\\n“Sure, thanks. I’ll take some whiskey.”\\n\\n“Help yourself! There’s coke in the fridge too.”\\n\\nI opened the bottle of Pendleton’s and poured myself a glass. It’s not a bad sipping whiskey, so I skipped the coke. Luna grabbed my hand and led me to her room. It was just as gorgeous as her. There were real flowers all over. A bird cage hung in the corner of the room with two birds inside. A large harp sat in the adjacent corner. The painting of the moon was right where it was in the photo. It was magnificent.\\n\\n“I painted that a couple years ago.”\\n\\n“It’s amazing. Are you an art major?”\\n\\nShe laughed. “Oh no, I was an English major. I’m in grad school now.”\\n\\nI took a sip of whiskey. “So what are you studying?”\\n\\n“How to teach college level English and Greek literature.”\\n\\n“Like *The Odyssey* and shit?”\\n\\n“Yeah,” she laughed, “like *The Odyssey* and shit. I’m not a big fan of that one though.”\\n\\n“Why not? Isn’t that like the main one?” I finished my whiskey.\\n\\n“Not a big fan of Odysseus.”\\n\\n“Total douche right?” I was just being funny. I’ve never read *The Odyssey.*\\n\\nShe thought that was hilarious. “Something like that.”\\n\\n“So you paint, play the harp apparently, and look like that. Why are you in Lubbock?”\\n\\nLuna giggled. “I don’t know. Guess I’m just trapped. I like school and haven’t wanted to go anywhere else.” She walked up to me and put her hand on my chest. “The men aren’t bad here either.”\\n\\nShe leaned in and kissed me. “Do you want another drink?”\\n\\nI was already pretty drunk, but nodded.\\n\\n“I’ll be right back.” She blew a kiss and walked out of the room.\\n\\n*Holy fuck.* I thought.\\n\\nThis couldn’t be happening. She was drop dead gorgeous. She was obviously smart. She had a good sense of humor and seemed like she had her shit together. Was this real? Was I dreaming? I wish had been.\\n\\nI looked at another painting hanging on the wall between the bird cage and the harp. The birds were quieter than I figured birds would be, but then again, I don’t know shit about birds. The painting was of a stormy ocean scene. In the center of the painting was a group of rocks with waves crashing on them and lightning crawling across the sky behind them. The painting seemed empty. I thought something more interesting should have been the focus of the painting rather than some boring rocks. That was when I noticed the faint mast of a ship protruding ever so slightly from the waves.\\n\\nThe bathroom door next to the harp had a beautiful tapestry adorning it. It looked ancient. At least, the picture did. It seemed to depict different tiers with various scenes happening in each section. One had fire and distorted figures. One had water. Some of the other scenes were damaged and couldn’t be made out. I leaned in closer to look at one scene—a field of flowers. The birds began to chirp. I ran my finger across the worn fabric. The birds grew louder.\\n\\nI was curious as to how clean she really was, so I started for the bathroom’s door handle. The birds’ chirping turned to ear piercing shrieks and squawks. I dropped my hand and turned to look at the birds. Just then, Luna came back in with a glass of white wine and a generous serving of whiskey.\\n\\n“Jesus, that’s a lot.” I smiled and said, “Thank you though.”\\n\\n“What? Can’t hang?” She smiled the most intoxicating smile I’ve ever seen.\\n\\nI took that as a cute challenge and slammed half of the whiskey. The chugging was punctuated by a harsh sigh as the whiskey burned my throat. Luna grabbed my hand and danced me around to her bed while downing her glass of wine in one gulp. She took the whiskey out of my hand and placed it on the bedside table.\\n\\nShe playfully pushed me backwards onto the black sheets. She got on top of me and started to kiss me. It was the most perfect kiss I’d ever had. Every bite of my lip and touch of her tongue left me wanting more. Her hand gently grabbed the side of my neck as her mouth went to the opposite side. She softly kissed my neck and then took my skin between her teeth. She began to suck the skin in like she was going to leave a hickey. It felt amazing. Then she sucked harder and bit violently.\\n\\n“Fuck!”\\n\\n“What?’ She sat up. “Are you okay?”\\n\\n“Yeah, that was just a little hard.”\\n\\n“Guess I’ll go easy on you.” She smiled that intoxicating smile and pulled her shirt off. Then she stood up and pulled my boots off.\\n\\n“You’re fucking gorgeous.”\\n\\n“Thank you. You’re not bad yourself.” She winked, threw her shirt on the floor, and reached for the lamp.\\n\\nThe light went out and the room was illuminated by the moonlight coming through the window by her bed. We fell into each other’s arms and kissed while stripping every piece of clothing off. We rolled around in the covers and kissed every inch of each other’s bodies. She was the most amazing woman I’d ever slept with. It sure felt that way too. At one point she turned over and I saw her back for the first time. She had the most beautiful and realistic wings tattooed on her back. She couldn’t have been any more perfect.\\n\\nShe turned and said, “What are you waiting for?”\\n\\nI began to speak and then paused. Her eyes looked black again. And not just the irises.\\n\\n“I…I just noticed your tattoo. I love it.”\\n\\n“I appreciate it, but maybe we can talk tattoos after?”\\n\\nI was really drunk, so I brushed it off. I laughed nervously. “Yeah, sure.”\\n\\nWe continued to make love and it was just as perfect as I thought it would be. We groped each other passionately and danced in the sheets by the light of the moon. Then the alcohol started to get to me. I felt sick, so I suppressed the feeling as best I could. I was sweating profusely and needed a break, but didn’t want to kill the mood, so I kissed Luna on the neck, then chest, then stomach. My hand went from her side, to her thigh, to her knee, then calf, then foot.\\n\\nThe skin on her foot didn’t feel like the rest of her though. What should have been smooth, freshly pedicured skin felt rough and scaly. Not calloused from walking on concrete barefoot either. Like actual scales. Unhuman.\\n\\nI pulled my hand away and reared back.\\n\\n“What’s wrong baby?”\\n\\n“I d…don’t feel so good.”\\n\\n“Too much to drink?”\\n\\nI slid off the bed and onto my feet, rubbing my eyes. Her feet slithered across the satin black sheets as she sensually moved her body in the bed, beckoning me to come back. They looked normal. I was fucked up and imagining things. I had to be.\\n\\n“Something like that.” I felt lightheaded and uncomfortable. Something was happening to me.\\n\\nShe sat up in the bed, leaning back on her hands. The moonlight danced on her skin and shone off her perfect body. She was looking at the moon in the sky. I went from engrossing euphoria like I had just taken Molly to feeling like the world was crashing down around me. I felt like death.\\n\\n“I’m going to go to the bathroom real quick.”\\n\\nI turned for the bathroom.\\n\\n“I don’t think you’ll like what you find through that door. Why don’t you come back?”\\n\\nI didn’t pay any attention to what she said and reached for the handle. My heart was racing. I wanted to throw up. I grabbed the handle and pulled the door open. I stepped onto a cold, wet floor and reached for the light switch. What I witnessed will never be unseen.\\n\\nThe claustrophobic space wasn’t a bathroom. There was white tile and a mirror, but no toilet, sink, or cabinets. I say it was white, but it was more red than anything. Crimson covered the floor and walls. Some splattered the ceiling like horrific modern art. What used to be human torsos hung from hooks in the confined space—all missing limbs besides one that had the remnants of quadriceps and hamstrings still connected to it. It’s insides were hollowed out so perfectly that you could see the shattered rib cage and spine barely hanging onto the pelvis. One of the limbless carcasses was completely skinned like it had come right from the pages of an anatomy textbook.\\n\\nI vomited violently, wiped my mouth, and turned to the thing sitting in the bed. She—it—turned its head toward me. It wasn’t the hauntingly beautiful face I had seen on my phone at the bar, or the one I had been kissing for the past hour. It was just haunting with no traces of beauty. The eyes were black as death. The skin was whiter than a ghost. It smiled. It wasn’t intoxicating anymore. It was wicked and sickening.\\n\\n“***Come back to bed handsome***.” It’s thin, razor sharp teeth glistened.\\n\\nI sprinted for the bedroom door and pulled it open as fast as I could. I grabbed the handle on the other side and slammed it shut. Putting my foot against the wall next to it, I held it closed as strongly as I could while whatever was on the other side slammed into it repeatedly. It eventually stopped.\\n\\nThe apartment door was ten feet away. If I was fast, I might be able to make it. There was a knife on the counter and I could grab that on the way. It probably wouldn’t help, but I was willing to try.\\n\\n*Okay, okay.* I sighed deeply. *You’ve got this.*\\n\\nI did not, but I went for it anyways. I sprinted towards the door grabbing the knife off the counter. In the moment, the last thing I was worried about was kitchen safety. I grabbed half handle and half blade. It hurt like a motherfucker, but I made it to the door. I opened it and bolted for the stairs.\\n\\nWhat I once knew as Luna lurched through the doorway. I was at the end of the hallway almost to the stairwell. I turned to look. It wasn’t even trying to move fast. It crawled down the hallway in the flickering lights. Every few seconds it was bathed in darkness then illuminated by phosphorescent light.\\n\\nI made it into the stairwell and ran down the stairs as fast as I could. As I reached the landing halfway between the first and second floor, the entrance to the stairwell shot open. A pale, clawed hand wrapped around the frame as the menacing face of my pursuer came through the doorway.\\n\\n“**WOULDN”T YOU LIKE TO FINISH YOUR DRINK?**”\\n\\nStill no one in the lobby. The glass doors were open. Maybe something was looking out for me. Maybe the West Texas wind was just keeping them propped open. In the moment, I needed it to be the former.\\n\\nI made a mad dash for Avenue Q which couldn’t have been more than fifty yards away. There was still some traffic. I needed to flag someone down. I saw a car and waved my arms hysterically. Red and blue lights flashed. I was naked and holding a knife, but I assumed my odds of surviving were infinitely better with a cop than back in that building.\\n\\nThe car screeched to a halt. I turned back towards the building to see if I was being pursued. A dark figure stood in the middle of the road under a lone street light. I couldn’t make out any details of my assailant. Black shapes morphed off of the figure as devilish wings unfurled behind it. Something stood under the pale glow of the streetlamp with eerily beautiful wings stretching towards the sky.\\n\\nI turned back. The cop had his gun drawn on me, ordering me to drop the knife and put my hands in the air. I did. A second man got out of the squad car. He wore a cowboy hat and pearl snaps. That was comforting. His hand rested on a 9mm on his side a few inches of cowhide away from a large belt buckle. That was less comforting.\\n\\n“Put your hands on your head, turn away from me, and get on your knees!” The officer yelled.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI placed my hands on my head, fingers interlocked, and turned my back towards the cop. The street was empty. Whatever it was that messaged me last night was gone. Luna was gone. I was safe.\\n\\nI’m writing this from a hospital bed at University Medical Center right next to my alma mater, Texas Tech University. After explaining what happened to the cops while doing my best to leave out bodies, demons, or wings, they found the events of last night and early this morning quite hilarious. They say I was robbed by a girl using Tinder to lure young men to her apartment.\\n\\n“You sure know how to pick ‘em young man.” A round man named Officer Johnson quipped to laughter from another uniform. I imagine that I made these boys’ night a lot more entertaining.\\n\\n“Sir, that wasn’t Cardi B back there trying to take my cash. It was a fucking murderer or something.”\\n\\n“Then where’s your wallet and clothes?” The cop in the back of the room just about died laughing.\\n\\n*God damn it.*\\n\\nTo my surprise, they found nothing at the apartment building. There actually isn’t a Room 237. One officer said I must have been “too fucked up to get the details right.” Apparently they’re questioning residents of the apartment building to try and find the “person” that “robbed me.”\\n\\nIt wasn’t a person that brought me to that apartment though. I know it wasn’t. I truly believe evil exists in this world now. It doesn’t have a skin color, body type, or gender. It is indiscriminately violent and resides where we least expect it. It hides among us and exploits our weaknesses. Mine was a pretty face.\\n\\nAll I needed was stitches for the cut on my hand and Gatorade for this hangover. As soon as I’m discharged, I’m driving to Dallas to see Ashley. I’m not sure if she’ll want me back, or even care if I show up, but I’d just be happy to see her. I just want to be somewhere safe. Whether that be in Dallas with her, or a million miles away, I just need to leave this place. The cops brought my car to the hospital for me and the doctors say I’ll be able to leave soon. Thank God I’m alive.\\n\\nOh, and did I mention? My nurse is gorgeous.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it feels good to be sad. We may not admit it to ourselves or anyone else, but wallowing in self-pity while listening to some sad, old country song can feel pretty good sometimes. Especially when you’ve had a little to drink. Last night I decided I could use a lot to drink with a guitar crying in the background while I beat myself up for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Why was I feeling like this? Well, a few weeks ago my girl left me. We spent what I thought were three perfect years together, but I guess she had just about enough of me. We graduated from Tech about a year ago. Her degree was in biology. Mine was in poly sci. We met in a philosophy class sophomore year. One day, she caught me staring while the professor spoke about people on train tracks getting slaughtered by trolleys or drowning children. I can’t remember honestly. Probably why I got a C.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She had dreams of ol’ Big D and a cute, picturesque life fit for Instagram. I had, well, dreams of jack shit and that was part of her problem with me. To quote Mac Davis, I guess happiness was Lubbock, Texas in her rear view mirror. For me, happiness was another season of Saturdays at the Jones and a few dozen more nights stumbling on the bricks of Broadway. Staying here was just fine with me, but after last night I need to be as far away from this place as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After work, I went home and got right to drinking. I should’ve went to the gym or cleaned the house or done literally anything other than cracking open a cold one. It seems to be my favorite pass time these days though. I took the top off of a Shiner and sank into the couch.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey Google, play some Merle Haggard.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Playing Merle Haggard on Google Play Music.” The sweet, synthetic voice of Google Home replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took out my phone to mindlessly scroll on Facebook. Picture of a couple at a concert, NY Times article about escalating tensions with Iran, a Trump quote that would’ve surprised me a few years ago, wedding photo, shooting in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck this.&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself after realizing for the thousandth time that social media would just suck what little happiness I had right out of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I set my phone on the coffee table and picked up my roommate’s animal science text book. Flipping through the pages, I wondered what Ashley was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probably already with somebody new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Some species of birds have their songs encoded in their DNA. Evolution saw to it that these species could instinctually attract mates and ward off other males.” I read aloud from the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Must be nice.&lt;/em&gt; I tossed the book on the coffee table and took a few pulls from my second beer of the evening. I felt myself drifting off thinking of Ashley and her perfect life in the metroplex.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…no woman gonna’ change the way I think. I think I’ll just stay here and drink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke to Merle’s voice and an upbeat piano tune. My watch said it was 11:59. I checked the fridge and there was only two beers left.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think I’ll just stay here and drink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;*“*I don’t think so Merle. I’d rather be alone surrounded by other people.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It being the witching hour, I couldn’t buy beer anywhere besides from a bootlegger. I don’t know any of those, so I decided I’d go listen to some no name artist at the Blue Light. With a couple sprays of cologne and a fresh pearl snap shirt, I headed out the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I arrived around 12:20 giving me a solid hour or so to get properly fucked up and Uber home. The place was as empty as you’d imagine on a Tuesday night, but sometimes you’d be surprised by the crowd in the Depot on a weekday. I was certain I’d find some kind of trouble to get into even with an empty bar.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was a couple dancing on the hardwood floor and people scattered on stools throughout the bar. I sat down and ordered a Shiner. The bartender struck up conversation with me probably figuring I could use the company. We talked a bit about various topics. William Clark Green had been in the night before and played a few songs. The new football coach was apparently a hard ass and Pat Mahomes was slowly making the Chiefs a team the bartender could “actually give a fuck about.” The conversation eventually dissolved into talking about tornadoes and I was reaching my limit with the small talk.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Can I get a shot of silver tequila, chilled and dressed?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure thing bud.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, and another Shiner please.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Gotcha’.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down the bar at a pretty blonde woman. She was older than me and dressed like she was about a decade removed from undergrad. A giant rock sat on her left ring finger gleaming in the neon. She was sitting all alone, so maybe she wasn’t too happy with the home life. Just as I had that thought, a monster of a man walked out of the bathroom and sat on the stool next to her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Not a lot of girls in here tonight, huh?.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” He laughed while setting my shot down. “You’ll have to come back Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I licked the salt off the rim, downed the shot, and bit the lime to ease the bite. “Yeah, maybe I’ll see you then.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my phone and opened Tinder—a favorite time killer when I was a few drinks deep. A brunette Tri Delt who looked like fun. &lt;em&gt;Yep.&lt;/em&gt; A blonde with tattoos and a couple kids. &lt;em&gt;Fuck it. Yep.&lt;/em&gt; Another blonde with a camo hat. “Looking for a man with a truck who’s six feet…” &lt;em&gt;Nope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I swiped through a few more profiles before coming to a beautiful, black haired girl sitting on a black bed biting her finger. She was fair skinned and more gorgeous than any woman two-stepping on the dancefloor behind me. Her name was Luna and her eyes were black as night. They had a sadness to them. Maybe I thought she was like me and looking for someone to take the place of some far off ex-lover. A painting of the Moon hung on the wall behind her and flowers adorned the room. I swiped right. I sipped on my beer and swiped for a few more minutes until the app stuttered and granted me with a notification that I matched with Luna.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well shit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think that would happen, but now I wish it hadn’t. I finished my beer while my phone chimed. “Luna messaged you!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the message. It said, “Hey!” and had a winky face next to it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, a message like that from a girl that hot with only one picture had to be a hooker, a man, or a Nigerian prince looking to give me some of his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another message popped up. “You’re very handsome. You should text me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The phone number had a local area code and she didn’t speak broken English. Maybe this was a real one. I decided to take my chances.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. You’re gorgeous. “&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I replied and we texted back and forth while I drank a few more beers. We talked about her ex and my ex and what we were doing in life. Definitely not a Nigerian prince. Could still be a man, a hooker, or both. I was willing to find out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Luna finally sent a text that said, “Wanna’ come over?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m no stranger to bad decisions and decided to make another one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure. What’s your address?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her place was conveniently close. Less than a ten minute drive according to my phone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey boss, can I close out?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bartender nodded and fetched my card. I left a tip reflective of my suddenly chipper mood and danced right out the door. I popped the collar on my jacket and pulled out a cigarette. Three drunk girls were yelling nonsense across the street and one fell down laughing, dragging one of the others down with her. I smiled with the corner of my mouth and lit the cigarette. I took a deep drag and blew it out looking over my shoulder at the lonely place I just left. I had a feeling it was going to be a good night. I’ve never been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the car I inputted Luna’s address and headed that way. I was probably over the limit, but it was the last thing on my mind at the time. I turned onto Texas Ave. and stopped at a red light. “Hey Siri, play Midland.” I sang along in an ignorantly giddy mood. The music would fade out as Siri offered directions periodically. “Put the Hurt on Me” played for most of the short drive. I pulled up to a leaning, grey building to the sound of a woozy electric guitar and sad lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kill me softly baby with your kiss. If I go, I wanna’ go like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shut the car off and walked up to the doors. I buzzed apartment number 237.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hey, it’s me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh sweet! Come up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The door clicked and it let me through. There was no one in the lobby of the building. The elevator was out of order. After taking the stairs, I entered a hallway with flickering lights. I was already anxious about who was going to be on the other side of this apartment door and the horror movie shit wasn’t helping. On the door hung a little moon that looked like it came from Etsy. That made me feel a little better since it was consistent with the name and room decorations from her profile. I knocked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A stunning, dark haired woman opened the door. The Nigerian prince and man scenarios were out. Still could’ve been a hooker, but I was pretty sure they didn’t work from home. Her eyes weren’t black at all. They were a hauntingly beautiful greyish blue. The picture didn’t do her justice. I couldn’t believe this woman was really standing in front of me. I couldn’t even speak. I tried saying, “Hey!” but it didn’t come out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi.” Her voice was incredibly pretty and came from the most beautiful lips I’d ever seen. I was already hearing wedding bells.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hi.” Something finally came out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So do you want to come in?” She laughed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, sorry.” I laughed too, but much more nervously.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her apartment was nice. It wasn’t at all indicative of the exterior of the shabby building I entered a few minutes prior.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I like your apartment.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thanks! I’ve only been here a few months. I like it a lot.” She walked into the kitchen connected to the living room. “Do you want something to drink? I have wine, beer, and a bottle of whiskey.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sure, thanks. I’ll take some whiskey.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Help yourself! There’s coke in the fridge too.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened the bottle of Pendleton’s and poured myself a glass. It’s not a bad sipping whiskey, so I skipped the coke. Luna grabbed my hand and led me to her room. It was just as gorgeous as her. There were real flowers all over. A bird cage hung in the corner of the room with two birds inside. A large harp sat in the adjacent corner. The painting of the moon was right where it was in the photo. It was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I painted that a couple years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing. Are you an art major?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She laughed. “Oh no, I was an English major. I’m in grad school now.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took a sip of whiskey. “So what are you studying?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How to teach college level English and Greek literature.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Like &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and shit?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” she laughed, “like &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and shit. I’m not a big fan of that one though.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Why not? Isn’t that like the main one?” I finished my whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Not a big fan of Odysseus.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Total douche right?” I was just being funny. I’ve never read &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She thought that was hilarious. “Something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So you paint, play the harp apparently, and look like that. Why are you in Lubbock?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Luna giggled. “I don’t know. Guess I’m just trapped. I like school and haven’t wanted to go anywhere else.” She walked up to me and put her hand on my chest. “The men aren’t bad here either.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She leaned in and kissed me. “Do you want another drink?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was already pretty drunk, but nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be right back.” She blew a kiss and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy fuck.&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This couldn’t be happening. She was drop dead gorgeous. She was obviously smart. She had a good sense of humor and seemed like she had her shit together. Was this real? Was I dreaming? I wish had been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at another painting hanging on the wall between the bird cage and the harp. The birds were quieter than I figured birds would be, but then again, I don’t know shit about birds. The painting was of a stormy ocean scene. In the center of the painting was a group of rocks with waves crashing on them and lightning crawling across the sky behind them. The painting seemed empty. I thought something more interesting should have been the focus of the painting rather than some boring rocks. That was when I noticed the faint mast of a ship protruding ever so slightly from the waves.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bathroom door next to the harp had a beautiful tapestry adorning it. It looked ancient. At least, the picture did. It seemed to depict different tiers with various scenes happening in each section. One had fire and distorted figures. One had water. Some of the other scenes were damaged and couldn’t be made out. I leaned in closer to look at one scene—a field of flowers. The birds began to chirp. I ran my finger across the worn fabric. The birds grew louder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious as to how clean she really was, so I started for the bathroom’s door handle. The birds’ chirping turned to ear piercing shrieks and squawks. I dropped my hand and turned to look at the birds. Just then, Luna came back in with a glass of white wine and a generous serving of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus, that’s a lot.” I smiled and said, “Thank you though.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What? Can’t hang?” She smiled the most intoxicating smile I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I took that as a cute challenge and slammed half of the whiskey. The chugging was punctuated by a harsh sigh as the whiskey burned my throat. Luna grabbed my hand and danced me around to her bed while downing her glass of wine in one gulp. She took the whiskey out of my hand and placed it on the bedside table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She playfully pushed me backwards onto the black sheets. She got on top of me and started to kiss me. It was the most perfect kiss I’d ever had. Every bite of my lip and touch of her tongue left me wanting more. Her hand gently grabbed the side of my neck as her mouth went to the opposite side. She softly kissed my neck and then took my skin between her teeth. She began to suck the skin in like she was going to leave a hickey. It felt amazing. Then she sucked harder and bit violently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What?’ She sat up. “Are you okay?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, that was just a little hard.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Guess I’ll go easy on you.” She smiled that intoxicating smile and pulled her shirt off. Then she stood up and pulled my boots off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re fucking gorgeous.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you. You’re not bad yourself.” She winked, threw her shirt on the floor, and reached for the lamp.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The light went out and the room was illuminated by the moonlight coming through the window by her bed. We fell into each other’s arms and kissed while stripping every piece of clothing off. We rolled around in the covers and kissed every inch of each other’s bodies. She was the most amazing woman I’d ever slept with. It sure felt that way too. At one point she turned over and I saw her back for the first time. She had the most beautiful and realistic wings tattooed on her back. She couldn’t have been any more perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She turned and said, “What are you waiting for?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I began to speak and then paused. Her eyes looked black again. And not just the irises.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I…I just noticed your tattoo. I love it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate it, but maybe we can talk tattoos after?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was really drunk, so I brushed it off. I laughed nervously. “Yeah, sure.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We continued to make love and it was just as perfect as I thought it would be. We groped each other passionately and danced in the sheets by the light of the moon. Then the alcohol started to get to me. I felt sick, so I suppressed the feeling as best I could. I was sweating profusely and needed a break, but didn’t want to kill the mood, so I kissed Luna on the neck, then chest, then stomach. My hand went from her side, to her thigh, to her knee, then calf, then foot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The skin on her foot didn’t feel like the rest of her though. What should have been smooth, freshly pedicured skin felt rough and scaly. Not calloused from walking on concrete barefoot either. Like actual scales. Unhuman.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my hand away and reared back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong baby?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I d…don’t feel so good.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Too much to drink?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slid off the bed and onto my feet, rubbing my eyes. Her feet slithered across the satin black sheets as she sensually moved her body in the bed, beckoning me to come back. They looked normal. I was fucked up and imagining things. I had to be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Something like that.” I felt lightheaded and uncomfortable. Something was happening to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She sat up in the bed, leaning back on her hands. The moonlight danced on her skin and shone off her perfect body. She was looking at the moon in the sky. I went from engrossing euphoria like I had just taken Molly to feeling like the world was crashing down around me. I felt like death.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to go to the bathroom real quick.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned for the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think you’ll like what you find through that door. Why don’t you come back?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t pay any attention to what she said and reached for the handle. My heart was racing. I wanted to throw up. I grabbed the handle and pulled the door open. I stepped onto a cold, wet floor and reached for the light switch. What I witnessed will never be unseen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The claustrophobic space wasn’t a bathroom. There was white tile and a mirror, but no toilet, sink, or cabinets. I say it was white, but it was more red than anything. Crimson covered the floor and walls. Some splattered the ceiling like horrific modern art. What used to be human torsos hung from hooks in the confined space—all missing limbs besides one that had the remnants of quadriceps and hamstrings still connected to it. It’s insides were hollowed out so perfectly that you could see the shattered rib cage and spine barely hanging onto the pelvis. One of the limbless carcasses was completely skinned like it had come right from the pages of an anatomy textbook.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I vomited violently, wiped my mouth, and turned to the thing sitting in the bed. She—it—turned its head toward me. It wasn’t the hauntingly beautiful face I had seen on my phone at the bar, or the one I had been kissing for the past hour. It was just haunting with no traces of beauty. The eyes were black as death. The skin was whiter than a ghost. It smiled. It wasn’t intoxicating anymore. It was wicked and sickening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come back to bed handsome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.” It’s thin, razor sharp teeth glistened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sprinted for the bedroom door and pulled it open as fast as I could. I grabbed the handle on the other side and slammed it shut. Putting my foot against the wall next to it, I held it closed as strongly as I could while whatever was on the other side slammed into it repeatedly. It eventually stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The apartment door was ten feet away. If I was fast, I might be able to make it. There was a knife on the counter and I could grab that on the way. It probably wouldn’t help, but I was willing to try.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, okay.&lt;/em&gt; I sighed deeply. &lt;em&gt;You’ve got this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did not, but I went for it anyways. I sprinted towards the door grabbing the knife off the counter. In the moment, the last thing I was worried about was kitchen safety. I grabbed half handle and half blade. It hurt like a motherfucker, but I made it to the door. I opened it and bolted for the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I once knew as Luna lurched through the doorway. I was at the end of the hallway almost to the stairwell. I turned to look. It wasn’t even trying to move fast. It crawled down the hallway in the flickering lights. Every few seconds it was bathed in darkness then illuminated by phosphorescent light.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I made it into the stairwell and ran down the stairs as fast as I could. As I reached the landing halfway between the first and second floor, the entrance to the stairwell shot open. A pale, clawed hand wrapped around the frame as the menacing face of my pursuer came through the doorway.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;WOULDN”T YOU LIKE TO FINISH YOUR DRINK?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Still no one in the lobby. The glass doors were open. Maybe something was looking out for me. Maybe the West Texas wind was just keeping them propped open. In the moment, I needed it to be the former.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I made a mad dash for Avenue Q which couldn’t have been more than fifty yards away. There was still some traffic. I needed to flag someone down. I saw a car and waved my arms hysterically. Red and blue lights flashed. I was naked and holding a knife, but I assumed my odds of surviving were infinitely better with a cop than back in that building.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The car screeched to a halt. I turned back towards the building to see if I was being pursued. A dark figure stood in the middle of the road under a lone street light. I couldn’t make out any details of my assailant. Black shapes morphed off of the figure as devilish wings unfurled behind it. Something stood under the pale glow of the streetlamp with eerily beautiful wings stretching towards the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back. The cop had his gun drawn on me, ordering me to drop the knife and put my hands in the air. I did. A second man got out of the squad car. He wore a cowboy hat and pearl snaps. That was comforting. His hand rested on a 9mm on his side a few inches of cowhide away from a large belt buckle. That was less comforting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands on your head, turn away from me, and get on your knees!” The officer yelled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I placed my hands on my head, fingers interlocked, and turned my back towards the cop. The street was empty. Whatever it was that messaged me last night was gone. Luna was gone. I was safe.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this from a hospital bed at University Medical Center right next to my alma mater, Texas Tech University. After explaining what happened to the cops while doing my best to leave out bodies, demons, or wings, they found the events of last night and early this morning quite hilarious. They say I was robbed by a girl using Tinder to lure young men to her apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You sure know how to pick ‘em young man.” A round man named Officer Johnson quipped to laughter from another uniform. I imagine that I made these boys’ night a lot more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Sir, that wasn’t Cardi B back there trying to take my cash. It was a fucking murderer or something.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Then where’s your wallet and clothes?” The cop in the back of the room just about died laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God damn it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, they found nothing at the apartment building. There actually isn’t a Room 237. One officer said I must have been “too fucked up to get the details right.” Apparently they’re questioning residents of the apartment building to try and find the “person” that “robbed me.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a person that brought me to that apartment though. I know it wasn’t. I truly believe evil exists in this world now. It doesn’t have a skin color, body type, or gender. It is indiscriminately violent and resides where we least expect it. It hides among us and exploits our weaknesses. Mine was a pretty face.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All I needed was stitches for the cut on my hand and Gatorade for this hangover. As soon as I’m discharged, I’m driving to Dallas to see Ashley. I’m not sure if she’ll want me back, or even care if I show up, but I’d just be happy to see her. I just want to be somewhere safe. Whether that be in Dallas with her, or a million miles away, I just need to leave this place. The cops brought my car to the hospital for me and the doctors say I’ll be able to leave soon. Thank God I’m alive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention? My nurse is gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

What&amp;#39;s more, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;ve heard both nurse&amp;#39;s names before, outside of Ara&amp;#39;s signature as the attendant of my birth. However, I&amp;#39;m drawing some big blanks on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I know of them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know for sure if I was the baby that Nurse was holding. However, given the surviving nurse signed my birth certificate, it&amp;#39;s the simplest and scariest conclusion. I&amp;#39;m not sure if I should try to look more into this, or if I should just try and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cogchoir/\"&gt;forget I read all of this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I\\'m posting here on the off-chance that someone knows something about this. I know the odds aren\\'t in my favor here, but I\\'m out of ideas. if anyone knows anything about a company named \"Nefertum Tech\", please get in touch with me. But I\\'m getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning, for context sake.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I was 12, I told my mother that my dad had been cheating on her for years. My dad never blamed me for the divorce that followed, but he did wonder how I knew about his unfaithfulness. The truth was simple. All I had to do was look at him, and I could see everything that he was hiding. It\\'s something I\\'ve been able to do for as long as I can remember. When I look at people, I see faint images hovering around them. Over time I realized that these are images of their past. But these images aren\\'t just moments from the past, they\\'re more akin to important memories, like birthday parties, graduations, and of course, sexual affairs.\\n\\nWhile this ability did occasionally provide me with dirty secrets, I found that more often than not it gave me a good idea of what kind of person someone was. For example, if I looked at someone, and all I saw was memories of them yelling and fighting, I would infer that they probably wouldn\\'t be so forgiving if they figured out it was me who rear ended their car in the parking lot, and then I would book it the fuck out of there.\\n\\nBut the benefits of this ability didn\\'t stop there, I also used it to make a decent living as a therapist, because what kind of person would I be if I didn\\'t use it for monetary gain. After all, it\\'s easy to make someone open up about there problems when you already know all of their problems before they even sit on that dreadful leather chair.\\n\\nAll of this is to say that my job is pretty damn easy for me, until two days go that is. When I got the call, I thought it would be a pretty easy session, just some high-school sweethearts having relationship troubles, not my usual clients, but how hard could these two really be to help, I mean they probably just got in to their first fight or something trivial like that. I regretted taking their request withing seconds. Something was very wrong with this couple.\\n\\nThe girl was pretty standard, bleached blond hair, and a spray tan so orange that she put even the oompa loompas to shame. Her memories were all college parties and expensive houses, typical affluenza shit. All I have to do for people like her is appeal to their narcissism. Tell them to think about everything they love about themselves, and eventually they get so lost in self-flagellation that they forgot what they were even mad about in the first place. But i\\'m not here to rant about \"those damn millennials\" she seemed like a fine person in her own right, narcissism and all. it\\'s her boyfriend who worried me.\\n\\nAll of the memories floating around him were completely black, or at least I though they were at first glance. Upon staring at them for a bit longer, I realized that there was something else to them; they were moving. It was too dark to make out what exactly it was, but I could see the movement. It\\'s like when you\\'re in a dark room, but you just know that something is in front of you. It was like I could feel something, violently thrashing around in that darkness. All my life, these images I see, they\\'ve always been stationary. But there was no doubt about it, there was something moving around in there.\\n\\nNevertheless, i had a job to do.\\n\\n\"So, what do you think is the reason your relationship is failing, Miss Blidish.\"\\n\\n\"Well, recently John hasn\\'t been completely open with me, he won;t even let me visit his parents!\" The spray tanned girl said.\\n\\n\"Okay, so why won\\'t you let her visit your parents? Are you scared of what they might think of her? There\\'s no reason for you to worry. If you love her, then they\\'ll be happy. Trust me.\" I said to her boyfriend.\\n\\nThe boy in front of me looked nervous, like he didn\\'t know how to respond. I decided to take a slower approach.\\n\\n\"So, John, tell me about yourself, what\\'s going on in your life?\" I asked him. He seemed more willing to answer this time.\\n\\n\"Well, I graduated from Brandeis University last month, and I just got a new job that pays pretty well.\" he responded.\\n\\n\"Yeah? What is it that you do?\"\\n\\n\"I work for a startup called Nefertum Tech.\"\\n\\n\"What do you do for this company?\" This time, he ignored my question.\\n\\nI continued making small talk with the couple while simultaneously dropping questions to gauge the problem, by the end of the session I felt like we made some real progress, but I couldn\\'t get the image of his black memories out of my head.\\n\\nWas it possible that this was just a normal guy? I mean the memories I see are always important moment. How could *that* be one of his most important memories. Moreover, how could it be his *only* important memory.\\n\\nAfter the couple left, it was business as usual. I met with a few more clients then closed up the office and headed home. As soon as I walked into my cramped apartment I stepped over my laundry littered floor and akwardly speed-walked to my computer, trying to make as little noise as possible, as to not get another complaint from my favorite downstairs neighbor.\\n\\nI wanted to just relax and browse reddit, but I couldn\\'t stop thinking about that damn guy who didn\\'t have memories. The first thing I tried was googling his name. Of course there was no relevant results, but it was worth a try. Next, I googled his college, Brandeis University. It was just some run of the mill college, nothing out of the ordinary. I decided to try one more thing before I just gave up and hit the hay. I tried searching, \"Nefertum Tech.\"\\n\\nI clicked on the first result and was met by a page that looked like it was made in 2006. It had a blue background, and used the impact font. the home page had two links, \"About\" and \"Contact Us, accompanying these links were clip art men in lab coats that danced around the screen. It was weirdly unsettling, it almost seemed as if it was simply an imitation of a business website instead of the real thing. I shook off the chills and forged ahead into the \"About\" section. All that was here was a paragraph that could have described any pretentious tech startup, using buzzwords words like \"professionalization\" and \"machine learning.\"\\n\\nI backed out to the homepage and hesitantly clicked the other link, \"Contact Us.\"\\n\\nThis time, I was met with a black screen. I reloaded the page multiple times to no avail. I was so close to just giving up when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. There it was, a floating image next to the computer, except this time, it was moving. It showed me, sitting in a computer with a man standing behind me. The computer screen was completely black, save for a small rectangular white text box.\\n\\n\"Enter the code.\" A faint voice echoed through my apartment. I was startled at first, but then I realized that it was coming from the floating image. A new terrifying first for me.\\n\\nIn the image, I obeyed the man, and typed in the word \"Creation.\"\\n\\n\"Very good.\" The man seemed pleased.\\n\\nThe image slowly faded away, and a new sound entered my ears. It was a soft, pulsing sound, but it was definitely there. It sounded like wind, steadily coursing through my room.\\n\\n*woosh*\\n\\n*woosh*\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t that, no, the more I listened to it, the more I came to terms with a horrifying conclusion: it was breathing. Slow, steady breathing, right outside of my door.\\n\\nI sat up in my chair as still as I could be, but the breathing didn\\'t stop, nor did it get louder, it just kept going.\\n\\n*woosh*\\n\\n*woosh*\\n\\nEventually, I just gave in, and walked towards my door. My legs were so close to giving out from fear, but I had no other option.\\n\\nWith shaking hands, I opened the door, and stepped into the hall. The usual lights that lit the hallway were out, leaving me surrounded by two paths shrouded in darkness. The breathing was now all around me, seemingly coming from every direction. I peered down the hall to my right, into the darkness, and felt the same sensation that I felt earlier at work, I felt movement. Somehow, I could see something moving towards me in the darkness, something big.\\n\\nI bolted back inside, and practically slammed the door behind me. I slumped down at my door, relief and terror coursing through my body at the same time. The breathing stopped, and I could see the light from the hallway pour back in through the cracks in my door, but there was no way I was going back out there. I trudged back to my computer and sat down. I immediately noticed two things.\\n\\nFirst, my computer. There was no web-page, not even a black screen. Just an error code. 404: Page not found.\\n\\nSecond, there were two things sloppily carved into my wooden desk. An address and a single word:\\n\\nTomorrow.',\n",

Tom had all the newest toys, cards, video game systems, or really anything a kid could want in life. This room was peculiar as it had padding on the walls. Tom and Reggie never thought much of it other than it meant they would rough house as much as they pleased.\\xa0 \\n\\nWhen Tom and Reggie would hang out it was almost ritualistic. Tom would always go to Reggie’s house and throw a pebble at Reggie’s bedroom window and then Reggie would come around from the back of the house and the they would proceed back to Tom’s to play in the extravagant playroom. \\n\\nAfter a long day of being out with his mom, Tom was excited to go get Reggie so that they could play some video games. As always Tom threw a pebble at Reggie’s bedroom window and Reggie came around from behind the house and they went back to Tom’s. \\n\\nAs soon as they got to the playroom they were both at each over who was going to be first player in the new game tom had just gotten that day with his mother. \\n\\nTom and Reggie were getting load arguing over who was going to get first player and Tom’s mother came into the room. \\n\\n“Keep it down in here!”, Tom’s mother said as if she has said this exact phrase a hundred times already today. \\n\\n“I am trying to relax before I make dinner--” \\n\\n“IT’S MY GAME.”, Tom exclaimed. \\n\\n“Okay okay, chill out.”, Reggie snickered. \\n\\n“Thomas settle down and just enjoy your game please.”, Tom’s mom demanded as she slammed the door as she left the playroom. \\n\\n“What’s wrong with your mom?”, asked Reggie as he swiftly swiped the first player controller. \\n\\n“I don’t know, It might have something to do with the errands we were running today, we went to the grocery store, the game store, the doctor, the post office, she paid bills at the post office, she ALWAYS hates doing that. I am sure that is what she is upset about.”, Tom pondered as he gave up on trying to be first player. \\n\\n“I like to watch anyway.”, Tom sat next to Reggie as they booted up the game system. \\n\\n“I’m thirsty!”, Reggie said as he was overtly gasping as if he hadn’t had a drink in weeks. \\n\\n“Let me go to the kitchen and see if we have any juice.”, Tom jumped up and walked out of the room. \\n\\nAs Tom walked into the kitchen he noticed his mother was get ready to make some dinner. Tom saw all the ingredients she needed to make his favorite meal; chicken alfredo.\\xa0 \\n\\nRemembering how much Reggie likes Tom’s mom’s chicken alfredo he blurts out, “Is it okay if Reggie stays for dinner?! Please mom, PLEASE!!!” \\n\\nTom’s mom sighs,” I have had a really long day Tom..” \\n\\nTom hastily replied,” Please..” \\n\\nHis mother caved, “Fine, but you have to take your medicine after dinner, no fighting me over it tonight.”\\xa0 \\n\\n“Deal!”, Tom was so excited he ran back to the playroom to tell Reggie he forgot the drinks for them. \\n\\n“Reggie, my mom is making chicken alfredo and she said you could stay for dinner.” Tom raved. \\n\\n“Cool, but the drinks? I’m dying over here,” Reggie joked. \\n\\n“Oh, my bad. Be right back.”\\xa0 \\n\\nTom went and grabbed some juice for the two of them and returned quickly. \\n\\n“My mom said dinner should be ready in about an hour, that will give us some time to at least beat the first level of the game.” \\n\\nAs Tom and Reggie play, time seems the fly by as an hour passes in what seems to be a blink of an eye. \\n\\n“Tom, dinner is ready!!” Tom could hear his mother from the other room. \\n\\n“Wow, this game is fun.” Tom said to Reggie. \\n\\n“Ya, I can’t wait to eat and come back and play some more.” Reggie affirmed. \\n\\nTom and Reggie rush to the dinner table in a hurry to get back to the new game. \\n\\nTom’s mom is just putting the chicken alfredo on the table. \\n\\n“MMMMMM, Looks delicious mom.” Tom said as his mouth was watering. \\n\\n“Serve yourself, its ready.” Tom’s mom said unexpectedly delightfully.\\xa0 \\n\\nAs Tom loads his plate up with food, Reggie looks at Tom to put food on his plate. Tom puts a few scoops of the delicious pasta onto Reggie’s plate. They both start eating their food like starving dogs. \\n\\n“Slow down, how can you even taste it when you eat that fast?” Tom’s mom postulated. \\n\\n“Sorry mom, we just really want to get back to the game you got me today, it is a lot of fun.” ,Tom said with a mouth full of food. \\n\\n“Please don’t speak with your mouth full honey.”, His mom scolded. \\n\\n“Sorry mom... I am finished, can me and Reggie be excused?”, Tom asked. \\n\\n“Yes, but remember what you promised me.” She said. \\n\\n“Ya, ya..” Tom replied, \\n\\n“Reggie meet me in my room I gotta do a quick chore.” Tom said embarrassed that he has to take medicine after dinner. \\n\\nReggie left the room and went back to the playroom. \\n\\n“Okay, where is the medicine?” Tom quipped. \\n\\nAs she reaches into her purse Tom’s mom said, “We have a new medication for you today.”\\xa0 \\n\\n“A new medication... What was wrong with my old one?”, Tom said with an attitude. \\n\\n“The doctor said it didn’t work remember?” She replied, “And lose that attitude mister.” \\n\\n“Sorry mom. I just feel like every few months it is some new pill I gotta take and I don’t feel like anything is wrong..”, Tom said. \\n\\n“The doctors say you have something wrong, so you have to--”, his mom said as she was interrupted.\\xa0 \\n\\n“What does that even mean..” Tom jarred. \\n\\n“It just means you have to take these special pills honey.”, his mother said as she tried to comfort him. \\n\\n“Just give me the pill.. I want to get back to playing games with Reggie.”, Tom was tired of arguing. \\n\\nTom took the pill and the went back to his playroom. Reggie was still at the menu of the video game.\\xa0 \\n\\n“Sorry about that, my mom had me take the trash out.”, Tom was lying but he couldn’t bring himself to talk about his medication.\\xa0 \\n\\n“It’s all good, we all have chores to do around the house.” Reggie said as he pressed start on the game. \\n\\n“Hey, its Saturday! Want me to see if my mom will let you stay the night? I bet we can beat the whole game tonight!?” Tom said excitedly. \\n\\n“Sure, I don’t care, I might have to ask my parents, let me text them, you go ask your mom.”, Reggie agreed. \\n\\nTom rushed out into the living room to plead with his mother to let Reggie stay, but tonight it did not take much begging for his mother to let Reggie stay. Tom hardly let his mom say yes before he was back in the playroom. \\n\\n“She said yes!” Tom said super excited. \\n\\n“My parents said they don’t mind.”, Reggie said. \\n\\n“Why don’t we invite some more people for a sleepover?”, Reggie blurted. \\n\\n“Nobody but you wants to hang out with me.. You know that..”, Tom sadly said. \\n\\n“That’s not true and you know it!”, Reggie said. \\n\\n“Even if it weren’t true, my mom would never let anyone besides you stay over..”, Tom said with whimper. \\n\\n“HA, Now that’s true.. Your mom can be kind of a--”, Reggie said as he was interrupted. \\n\\n“HEY! Don’t you finish that sentence!”, Tom said as the two chuckled. \\n\\nAs the night went on Tom and Reggie finished the game they were playing. It was getting late, they were both getting ready for bed.\\xa0 \\n\\n“That was a really fun game.” Tom said to Reggie. \\n\\n“Ya, I had a lot of fun with it. You always pick out the best games.”, Reggie proclaimed. \\n\\n“It is getting pretty late; we should probably get to sleep.” Tom yawned. \\n\\n“I agree. See you in the morning.” Reggie replied. \\n\\nTom slept like a rock that night. An earthquake couldn’t wake him. Dreaming of being the main character in the game him and Reggie just finished. \\n\\nThe morning seemed to come too quickly. Tom woke up, stretched his legs out as he yawned. Tom looked over at where Reggie was sleeping and all he saw was a perfectly made bed. Tom thought to himself that maybe Reggie just had to go early, but thought it was weird that he made his bed. Reggie never made his own bed after staying over. And certainly always said goodbye before leaving. \\n\\nTom decided to look around the house a bit for Reggie. He looked in the playroom to see if Reggie was playing the new game again. He wasn’t. Stumped, Tom went the kitchen where he smelled the sweet sizzling aroma of bacon.\\xa0 \\n\\n“Have you seen Reggie around?” Tom asked his mother. \\n\\n“Honey, you took your medicine yesterday.” His mother stated. \\n\\n“So, what does that have to do with anything?” Tom said with a worried look on his face. \\n\\n“The medicine was for your disorder. It means that you see people that aren’t real sweetheart..”, Tom’s mom said as she was holding back tears. \\n\\n“Reggie is real!”, Tom ran out of the kitchen and burst through the front door of the house.\\xa0 \\n\\nTom ran down to Reggie’s house, only to find that it looked like nobody had lived there for twenty or more years. Tom threw countless pebbles at the window that he thought was Reggie’s room.\\xa0 \\n\\nDefeated, Tom walked back home. \\n\\n“Are you okay?”, Tom’s mom said in a worried tone. \\n\\nTom was white as a ghost.\\n\\nEDIT: removed super specific disorder.',\n",
