I was in some dark places during my battles and want to write a post I would‚Äôve liked to have read then. So here it goes...

I‚Äôm not gonna go into full detail about my anxiety and specific triggers just because there‚Äôs not enough time, really. But I am gonna try to summarize some of the timeline and feelings I had along the way. Looking back,  I had dealt with some unpleasant anxiety as young as 7-8 years old, but got out of it largely scot-free. Unfortunately, it came raging back in the worst way in the summer of 2017. It had built up over the course of weeks/months and culminating in a awful panic attack just weeks before my birthday in July.

It paralyzed me. I could scarcely be social or leave the house without having complete nervous breakdowns. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy down time and lying around without being anxious. I felt trapped, and basically burned an entire summer feeling anxious before realizing once I returned to my university for my junior year that I was gonna lose my mind or worse if I didn‚Äôt deal with it. This began a journey that got me where I am today, where I can proudly say I experience little to no anxiety even on a weekly basis. What I want to do now is share what worked and what didn‚Äôt work.

(IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a psychologist or mental health expert of any kind. What I say is not gospel and I would much rather you do what works best for you, ideally with the help of a professional. Which I am not lol. This is just what worked for me, nothing more.)

INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. This worked really well for me once I got with somebody who really understood me and engaged with me. Starting in September 2017, I met weekly with a therapist from my school‚Äôs counseling center. While he was a great guy, he really just kinda listened to me and never made it a conversation and really never challenged me to think about/attack my anxiety in a new way. In hindsight, I think this limited my capacity to improve. In January of 2019, I began seeing a woman who was INCREDIBLE. She asked direct questions and engaged me in conversation, and constantly challenged me to re-visualize my anxiety and thoughts. She literally changed my life. I think 1-on-1 counseling is a great route to take, but make sure the sessions are having an impact. And do make sincere attempts to follow the advice and ‚Äúhomework‚Äù they give you! It helps!

GROUP THERAPY (CBT). Next to meeting the woman mentioned above, this was the next most helpful thing I did. I‚Äôm a huge introvert, I can legitimately name on one hand the number of close friends I have. I did not want to go this route and only did after being urged by my therapist. It was well-worth it. CBT itself is awesome and amazing, but getting to see other people experiencing what I went through helped tremendously. Everyone supported each other and shared their victories and I found it incredibly reassuring and helpful to have a positive environment to be in once a week. I highly recommend at least giving a shot to some kind of group or class therapy. 

OPENING UP TO OTHERS. This can be tough. As a 23 year old male, I felt the full brunt of the ‚Äúdudes can‚Äôt be anxious or sad or emotionally vulnerable‚Äù macho Bullshit that so many deal with. I was terrified of telling anybody about what I was going through. But in truth, I think you have to. Once I really opened up to my parents and girlfriend, things got easier. Having one or two people outside of a therapist that you can vent to and be emotional with can make such a difference. It‚Äôs scary, but well worth it. Whether it‚Äôs a friend, parent, cousin, coworker, significant other, whoever. Take a chance on having a friend you can talk to, even if it‚Äôs a complete stranger online. Someone is better than no one, your thoughts and feelings matter to someone. Even if you don‚Äôt know it yet. 

MEDICATION. I made a personal decision to not take medication for my anxiety, but I have seen it work wonders for my roommate and a number of other friends and acquaintances. I would definitely say to follow the advice of your therapist or doctor here. Just because it wasn‚Äôt for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not right for someone else. Figure out what works best for you and stick with it (:

EMBRACE LIFE AGAIN. This was a particular struggle for me. Even still, all I want to do when I‚Äôm anxious is hide in my room and play Xbox and ignore the world. But truthfully, that never made it better for me. What made it better was exposing myself to the world and those situations that bothered me. Eventually, I overcame those anxieties and I can‚Äôt even remember my last panic attack. You owe it to yourself to experience the world and all it‚Äôs people. Don‚Äôt overdo it, in fact take it slow. But you‚Äôll be SO proud of yourself once you‚Äôre able to just attack the day and go out in nature or out to dinner or to the store or whatever without experiencing crippling anxiety. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs worth it.

I want to leave y‚Äôall with this. Do not give up. Don‚Äôt ever give up. Take it from me. I was utterly hopeless for quite awhile and once was dealing with thoughts of self-harm and suicide on a daily basis because of my anxiety and thought things would never get better. But they do. They did for me, and they can and WILL for you too. It takes work and often can feel like hell, but it will get better. 

This world needs you and is far better with you on it. If nobody has told you today, I love you and think you are very handsome and sexy and would be happy to get to know you better. I think I covered everything that I wanted to, but if you have any questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them as best as I can (remember tho, I am not a professional lol. 

If you made it here, thanks for reading (:","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not totally sure what this post is going to end up looking like, but recently have felt that sharing my experiences with anxiety could provide some hope and encouragement to somebody needing it right now. I was in some dark places during my battles and want to write a post I would‚Äôve liked to have read then. So here it goes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not gonna go into full detail about my anxiety and specific triggers just because there‚Äôs not enough time, really. But I am gonna try to summarize some of the timeline and feelings I had along the way. Looking back,  I had dealt with some unpleasant anxiety as young as 7-8 years old, but got out of it largely scot-free. Unfortunately, it came raging back in the worst way in the summer of 2017. It had built up over the course of weeks/months and culminating in a awful panic attack just weeks before my birthday in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It paralyzed me. I could scarcely be social or leave the house without having complete nervous breakdowns. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy down time and lying around without being anxious. I felt trapped, and basically burned an entire summer feeling anxious before realizing once I returned to my university for my junior year that I was gonna lose my mind or worse if I didn‚Äôt deal with it. This began a journey that got me where I am today, where I can proudly say I experience little to no anxiety even on a weekly basis. What I want to do now is share what worked and what didn‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a psychologist or mental health expert of any kind. What I say is not gospel and I would much rather you do what works best for you, ideally with the help of a professional. Which I am not lol. This is just what worked for me, nothing more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. This worked really well for me once I got with somebody who really understood me and engaged with me. Starting in September 2017, I met weekly with a therapist from my school‚Äôs counseling center. While he was a great guy, he really just kinda listened to me and never made it a conversation and really never challenged me to think about/attack my anxiety in a new way. In hindsight, I think this limited my capacity to improve. In January of 2019, I began seeing a woman who was INCREDIBLE. She asked direct questions and engaged me in conversation, and constantly challenged me to re-visualize my anxiety and thoughts. She literally changed my life. I think 1-on-1 counseling is a great route to take, but make sure the sessions are having an impact. And do make sincere attempts to follow the advice and ‚Äúhomework‚Äù they give you! It helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GROUP THERAPY (CBT). Next to meeting the woman mentioned above, this was the next most helpful thing I did. I‚Äôm a huge introvert, I can legitimately name on one hand the number of close friends I have. I did not want to go this route and only did after being urged by my therapist. It was well-worth it. CBT itself is awesome and amazing, but getting to see other people experiencing what I went through helped tremendously. Everyone supported each other and shared their victories and I found it incredibly reassuring and helpful to have a positive environment to be in once a week. I highly recommend at least giving a shot to some kind of group or class therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPENING UP TO OTHERS. This can be tough. As a 23 year old male, I felt the full brunt of the ‚Äúdudes can‚Äôt be anxious or sad or emotionally vulnerable‚Äù macho Bullshit that so many deal with. I was terrified of telling anybody about what I was going through. But in truth, I think you have to. Once I really opened up to my parents and girlfriend, things got easier. Having one or two people outside of a therapist that you can vent to and be emotional with can make such a difference. It‚Äôs scary, but well worth it. Whether it‚Äôs a friend, parent, cousin, coworker, significant other, whoever. Take a chance on having a friend you can talk to, even if it‚Äôs a complete stranger online. Someone is better than no one, your thoughts and feelings matter to someone. Even if you don‚Äôt know it yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEDICATION. I made a personal decision to not take medication for my anxiety, but I have seen it work wonders for my roommate and a number of other friends and acquaintances. I would definitely say to follow the advice of your therapist or doctor here. Just because it wasn‚Äôt for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not right for someone else. Figure out what works best for you and stick with it (:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMBRACE LIFE AGAIN. This was a particular struggle for me. Even still, all I want to do when I‚Äôm anxious is hide in my room and play Xbox and ignore the world. But truthfully, that never made it better for me. What made it better was exposing myself to the world and those situations that bothered me. Eventually, I overcame those anxieties and I can‚Äôt even remember my last panic attack. You owe it to yourself to experience the world and all it‚Äôs people. Don‚Äôt overdo it, in fact take it slow. But you‚Äôll be SO proud of yourself once you‚Äôre able to just attack the day and go out in nature or out to dinner or to the store or whatever without experiencing crippling anxiety. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to leave y‚Äôall with this. Do not give up. Don‚Äôt ever give up. Take it from me. I was utterly hopeless for quite awhile and once was dealing with thoughts of self-harm and suicide on a daily basis because of my anxiety and thought things would never get better. But they do. They did for me, and they can and WILL for you too. It takes work and often can feel like hell, but it will get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world needs you and is far better with you on it. If nobody has told you today, I love you and think you are very handsome and sexy and would be happy to get to know you better. I think I covered everything that I wanted to, but if you have any questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them as best as I can (remember tho, I am not a professional lol. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been struggling with anxiety for most of my life. Although when I was younger I didn't know it was termed anxiety, I just assumed i was very nervous and everyone felt like this.

My panics would usually result in me unable to sleep, due to a racing, extremely pessimistic mind, loss of appetite and eventually throwing up mostly bile. Eventually whatever was causing the anxiety would pass and I'd slowly start to feel better.

My anxiety levels have shot through the roof and I've been struggling to function. After not eating anything for more than a day and still not feeling hungry, I thought I'd better book an appointment with my GP.

I have suffered with anxiety from the time I was young. My parents are divorced, a few family members passed away, and I‚Äôve dealt with some social anxiety, sports-related performance anxiety, and general feelings of stress from a young age.

I‚Äôve realized that anxiety is like any other emotion or response. It is an association our brain makes with anything that can be perceived harmful, and the worse the anxiety gets, the worse the connection grows. When playing baseball, I‚Äôd fall into traps where my anxiety took over. It‚Äôd cause my muscles to tense up, me to shake physically, and lose focus on ‚Äúkeeping my eye on the ball‚Äù. This lead to poor performance and more distress, and strengthened the anxious association even worse. When playing in less competitive leagues where the stress did not exist, I generally played well and never had this problem.

The way out of this was to lose that association, and not be so hard on myself. This applies to everyday life; if a phone call with my boss does not go as smoothly as I‚Äôd like, I know to let it go. If I beat myself up over it, the stress/anxiety response next time I speak to my boss will be worse because the stakes are higher

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt screw this up twice in a row can I?‚Äù

Try to avoid this trap. Don‚Äôt internalize or feel guilty of poor performance or anything that causes you anxiety. See it as something separate; when the feelings of heat and swearing and shaking arise just say ‚Äúthis is my anxiety not me‚Äù, and take a deep breathe.

Grandfather passed away in 2017 when I was 27 and then I had to take over his position as well and run his business until we could be taken over by another company, which didn't happen until less than 2 months ago.
My sister lives halfway across the US and I barely have any close family near me, although my boyfriend's family has pretty much ""adopted"" me, but they're so different from what mine was that it stresses me out half the time with the constant bickering. My family was always super civil. 

For the last 5+ years I've been having night terrors - screaming, thrashing, I even bit my boyfriend in my sleep. I'm now almost always exhausted because I rarely sleep well, and I'm also affecting my boyfriend's sleep. He's concerned the cops will be called and they won't believe that I was sleeping.

I posted about something similar yesterday about being on Sertaline and wanted to come off... I just have some questions!

Little back story

Been on Sertaline probably just over 2 years, because of anxiety. 

Had a ROUGH start 4-5 weeks on Sertaline. Didn‚Äôt leave my bed. Experienced the worst Depersonalisation which I hated so much, and just everything about it.

For the last 3 months I have been taking my medication inconsistently, Maybe 2 dosages(50mg) a week (7days).  I‚Äôm not sure why I wasn‚Äôt taking them Regular but I always wanted to come off them for some reason, yes it helps with my anxiety but also makes me feel different. 

Last Friday I hadn‚Äôt took one for 5 days and I didn‚Äôt even care about it, I felt fine... apart from the fact I was anxious what would happen if I didn‚Äôt take one... so I took one. Felt shitty after taking the doseage. Couple days later I feel fine again. Vice versa

5 days later (Yesterday) I took another doseage for the same reason... basically I‚Äôm nervous to come off them completely in case I experience Depersonalisation and all the weird feelings again... I never had Depersonalisation before I started taking them and only had it for the start of my medication but now it‚Äôs at the back of my mind if I stop

I had a little anxiety attack 30 mins ago and it‚Äôs because I took these doseages so irregular I think. I‚Äôd like to see how I will be off of them but I‚Äôm just nervous to try.. to see what changes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay.

4 years ago, I started taking Lexapro (10 mg), and experienced positive effects. Back in March of this year, I started to experience panic attacks frequently again, and upped my Lexapro to 20 mg.

3 Months later, the Lexapro no longer seems to be working. I went to the doctor's today and I was prescribed Cymbalta to be taken 30mg/day for the first week, while taking Lexapro at the same time, cutting my Lexapro dosage to 10 mg/day.

I am curious if anyone here has any experience switching antidepressent/anxiety meds, and if I should be worried about the side effects. My doctor assured me the side effects would be minimal if anything, and I have already been experiencing nausea due to anxiety for the past week or so, so I am hoping that will not get any worse.

Do you think weening off the Lexapro in just 1 week will cause me to experience withdrawals, and will the Cymbalta (30mg for first week, then 60mg after) cause any nausea or strange side effects?
