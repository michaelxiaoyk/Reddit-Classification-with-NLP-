Basically my story is I've had anxiety since I was really little and it got diagnosed at around the age of 15. I've been diagnosed with quite a lot of things but it's gone back and fourth between GAD and panic disorder. It was so bad I couldn't go into grocery stores, got pulled out of high school for 3 months, and was basically trapped in my house. 

I eventually got therapy and I got medication. The therapy helped a bit but the medication hasn't. I've been on so many medications now I worry I'm basically out if options. I have a weird issue where I get rare side effects and my body can't tolerate even normal doses of medication. 

I did end up going to college (I'm so proud I got myself to go) and am currently in my senior year. I've either been extraordinary sick (I have other medical issues as well) or anxious the entire time. This has led to no sleep, brain fog, and actually missing college. Which then has led to barely passing in almost every class (not for lack of trying) and I now worry how it will affect my career (I'm majoring in food science).

I try my best to get a job, but 99% of the places i apply to never even reply, and for the 1% that do, the interviews make me so anxious that i constantly fuck up.

I had an interview today with a local mcdonalds, a place where 2 of my friends work, which i was told is an easy interview and that I'd definitely get the job. I'm in desperate need of a job, and im in no position to turn down this opportunity, so i spent about 4 hours getting ready for it, dressing nice, researching questions and so on.

But because my cities public transport is terrible, i ended up having to get another bus, and i was likely going to be 10 minutes late, despite leaving plenty of time to get there.

Going to interviews is already incredibly stressful for me, and the idea of being late to one this important just terrified me, and so i just went home. Considering i couldn't even bring myself to just go to the interview for a job that im not even that excited for, makes it really hard to not think that I'm just useless at everything and ill never get anything important done.

I know that with more practice with actual interviews ill probably lose alot of the anxiety i have about them, but since ive only been offered 3 interviews in the past 6 months means thats not gonna happen.

Does anyone have any other ideas on how i could maybe get over this, or at least feel a bit more confident in professional situations?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m broke, living off my parents, and ive been unemployed for almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;
