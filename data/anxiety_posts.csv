I was in some dark places during my battles and want to write a post I would‚Äôve liked to have read then. So here it goes...

I‚Äôm not gonna go into full detail about my anxiety and specific triggers just because there‚Äôs not enough time, really. But I am gonna try to summarize some of the timeline and feelings I had along the way. Looking back,  I had dealt with some unpleasant anxiety as young as 7-8 years old, but got out of it largely scot-free. Unfortunately, it came raging back in the worst way in the summer of 2017. It had built up over the course of weeks/months and culminating in a awful panic attack just weeks before my birthday in July.

It paralyzed me. I could scarcely be social or leave the house without having complete nervous breakdowns. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy down time and lying around without being anxious. I felt trapped, and basically burned an entire summer feeling anxious before realizing once I returned to my university for my junior year that I was gonna lose my mind or worse if I didn‚Äôt deal with it. This began a journey that got me where I am today, where I can proudly say I experience little to no anxiety even on a weekly basis. What I want to do now is share what worked and what didn‚Äôt work.

(IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a psychologist or mental health expert of any kind. What I say is not gospel and I would much rather you do what works best for you, ideally with the help of a professional. Which I am not lol. This is just what worked for me, nothing more.)

INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. This worked really well for me once I got with somebody who really understood me and engaged with me. Starting in September 2017, I met weekly with a therapist from my school‚Äôs counseling center. While he was a great guy, he really just kinda listened to me and never made it a conversation and really never challenged me to think about/attack my anxiety in a new way. In hindsight, I think this limited my capacity to improve. In January of 2019, I began seeing a woman who was INCREDIBLE. She asked direct questions and engaged me in conversation, and constantly challenged me to re-visualize my anxiety and thoughts. She literally changed my life. I think 1-on-1 counseling is a great route to take, but make sure the sessions are having an impact. And do make sincere attempts to follow the advice and ‚Äúhomework‚Äù they give you! It helps!

GROUP THERAPY (CBT). Next to meeting the woman mentioned above, this was the next most helpful thing I did. I‚Äôm a huge introvert, I can legitimately name on one hand the number of close friends I have. I did not want to go this route and only did after being urged by my therapist. It was well-worth it. CBT itself is awesome and amazing, but getting to see other people experiencing what I went through helped tremendously. Everyone supported each other and shared their victories and I found it incredibly reassuring and helpful to have a positive environment to be in once a week. I highly recommend at least giving a shot to some kind of group or class therapy. 

OPENING UP TO OTHERS. This can be tough. As a 23 year old male, I felt the full brunt of the ‚Äúdudes can‚Äôt be anxious or sad or emotionally vulnerable‚Äù macho Bullshit that so many deal with. I was terrified of telling anybody about what I was going through. But in truth, I think you have to. Once I really opened up to my parents and girlfriend, things got easier. Having one or two people outside of a therapist that you can vent to and be emotional with can make such a difference. It‚Äôs scary, but well worth it. Whether it‚Äôs a friend, parent, cousin, coworker, significant other, whoever. Take a chance on having a friend you can talk to, even if it‚Äôs a complete stranger online. Someone is better than no one, your thoughts and feelings matter to someone. Even if you don‚Äôt know it yet. 

MEDICATION. I made a personal decision to not take medication for my anxiety, but I have seen it work wonders for my roommate and a number of other friends and acquaintances. I would definitely say to follow the advice of your therapist or doctor here. Just because it wasn‚Äôt for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not right for someone else. Figure out what works best for you and stick with it (:

EMBRACE LIFE AGAIN. This was a particular struggle for me. Even still, all I want to do when I‚Äôm anxious is hide in my room and play Xbox and ignore the world. But truthfully, that never made it better for me. What made it better was exposing myself to the world and those situations that bothered me. Eventually, I overcame those anxieties and I can‚Äôt even remember my last panic attack. You owe it to yourself to experience the world and all it‚Äôs people. Don‚Äôt overdo it, in fact take it slow. But you‚Äôll be SO proud of yourself once you‚Äôre able to just attack the day and go out in nature or out to dinner or to the store or whatever without experiencing crippling anxiety. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs worth it.

I want to leave y‚Äôall with this. Do not give up. Don‚Äôt ever give up. Take it from me. I was utterly hopeless for quite awhile and once was dealing with thoughts of self-harm and suicide on a daily basis because of my anxiety and thought things would never get better. But they do. They did for me, and they can and WILL for you too. It takes work and often can feel like hell, but it will get better. 

This world needs you and is far better with you on it. If nobody has told you today, I love you and think you are very handsome and sexy and would be happy to get to know you better. I think I covered everything that I wanted to, but if you have any questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them as best as I can (remember tho, I am not a professional lol. 

If you made it here, thanks for reading (:","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not totally sure what this post is going to end up looking like, but recently have felt that sharing my experiences with anxiety could provide some hope and encouragement to somebody needing it right now. I was in some dark places during my battles and want to write a post I would‚Äôve liked to have read then. So here it goes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not gonna go into full detail about my anxiety and specific triggers just because there‚Äôs not enough time, really. But I am gonna try to summarize some of the timeline and feelings I had along the way. Looking back,  I had dealt with some unpleasant anxiety as young as 7-8 years old, but got out of it largely scot-free. Unfortunately, it came raging back in the worst way in the summer of 2017. It had built up over the course of weeks/months and culminating in a awful panic attack just weeks before my birthday in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It paralyzed me. I could scarcely be social or leave the house without having complete nervous breakdowns. Hell, I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy down time and lying around without being anxious. I felt trapped, and basically burned an entire summer feeling anxious before realizing once I returned to my university for my junior year that I was gonna lose my mind or worse if I didn‚Äôt deal with it. This began a journey that got me where I am today, where I can proudly say I experience little to no anxiety even on a weekly basis. What I want to do now is share what worked and what didn‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not a psychologist or mental health expert of any kind. What I say is not gospel and I would much rather you do what works best for you, ideally with the help of a professional. Which I am not lol. This is just what worked for me, nothing more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING. This worked really well for me once I got with somebody who really understood me and engaged with me. Starting in September 2017, I met weekly with a therapist from my school‚Äôs counseling center. While he was a great guy, he really just kinda listened to me and never made it a conversation and really never challenged me to think about/attack my anxiety in a new way. In hindsight, I think this limited my capacity to improve. In January of 2019, I began seeing a woman who was INCREDIBLE. She asked direct questions and engaged me in conversation, and constantly challenged me to re-visualize my anxiety and thoughts. She literally changed my life. I think 1-on-1 counseling is a great route to take, but make sure the sessions are having an impact. And do make sincere attempts to follow the advice and ‚Äúhomework‚Äù they give you! It helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GROUP THERAPY (CBT). Next to meeting the woman mentioned above, this was the next most helpful thing I did. I‚Äôm a huge introvert, I can legitimately name on one hand the number of close friends I have. I did not want to go this route and only did after being urged by my therapist. It was well-worth it. CBT itself is awesome and amazing, but getting to see other people experiencing what I went through helped tremendously. Everyone supported each other and shared their victories and I found it incredibly reassuring and helpful to have a positive environment to be in once a week. I highly recommend at least giving a shot to some kind of group or class therapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPENING UP TO OTHERS. This can be tough. As a 23 year old male, I felt the full brunt of the ‚Äúdudes can‚Äôt be anxious or sad or emotionally vulnerable‚Äù macho Bullshit that so many deal with. I was terrified of telling anybody about what I was going through. But in truth, I think you have to. Once I really opened up to my parents and girlfriend, things got easier. Having one or two people outside of a therapist that you can vent to and be emotional with can make such a difference. It‚Äôs scary, but well worth it. Whether it‚Äôs a friend, parent, cousin, coworker, significant other, whoever. Take a chance on having a friend you can talk to, even if it‚Äôs a complete stranger online. Someone is better than no one, your thoughts and feelings matter to someone. Even if you don‚Äôt know it yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEDICATION. I made a personal decision to not take medication for my anxiety, but I have seen it work wonders for my roommate and a number of other friends and acquaintances. I would definitely say to follow the advice of your therapist or doctor here. Just because it wasn‚Äôt for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not right for someone else. Figure out what works best for you and stick with it (:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMBRACE LIFE AGAIN. This was a particular struggle for me. Even still, all I want to do when I‚Äôm anxious is hide in my room and play Xbox and ignore the world. But truthfully, that never made it better for me. What made it better was exposing myself to the world and those situations that bothered me. Eventually, I overcame those anxieties and I can‚Äôt even remember my last panic attack. You owe it to yourself to experience the world and all it‚Äôs people. Don‚Äôt overdo it, in fact take it slow. But you‚Äôll be SO proud of yourself once you‚Äôre able to just attack the day and go out in nature or out to dinner or to the store or whatever without experiencing crippling anxiety. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to leave y‚Äôall with this. Do not give up. Don‚Äôt ever give up. Take it from me. I was utterly hopeless for quite awhile and once was dealing with thoughts of self-harm and suicide on a daily basis because of my anxiety and thought things would never get better. But they do. They did for me, and they can and WILL for you too. It takes work and often can feel like hell, but it will get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world needs you and is far better with you on it. If nobody has told you today, I love you and think you are very handsome and sexy and would be happy to get to know you better. I think I covered everything that I wanted to, but if you have any questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them as best as I can (remember tho, I am not a professional lol. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been struggling with anxiety for most of my life. Although when I was younger I didn't know it was termed anxiety, I just assumed i was very nervous and everyone felt like this.

My panics would usually result in me unable to sleep, due to a racing, extremely pessimistic mind, loss of appetite and eventually throwing up mostly bile. Eventually whatever was causing the anxiety would pass and I'd slowly start to feel better.

I have suffered with anxiety from the time I was young. My parents are divorced, a few family members passed away, and I‚Äôve dealt with some social anxiety, sports-related performance anxiety, and general feelings of stress from a young age.

I‚Äôve realized that anxiety is like any other emotion or response. It is an association our brain makes with anything that can be perceived harmful, and the worse the anxiety gets, the worse the connection grows. When playing baseball, I‚Äôd fall into traps where my anxiety took over. It‚Äôd cause my muscles to tense up, me to shake physically, and lose focus on ‚Äúkeeping my eye on the ball‚Äù. This lead to poor performance and more distress, and strengthened the anxious association even worse. When playing in less competitive leagues where the stress did not exist, I generally played well and never had this problem.

The way out of this was to lose that association, and not be so hard on myself. This applies to everyday life; if a phone call with my boss does not go as smoothly as I‚Äôd like, I know to let it go. If I beat myself up over it, the stress/anxiety response next time I speak to my boss will be worse because the stakes are higher

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt screw this up twice in a row can I?‚Äù

Try to avoid this trap. Don‚Äôt internalize or feel guilty of poor performance or anything that causes you anxiety. See it as something separate; when the feelings of heat and swearing and shaking arise just say ‚Äúthis is my anxiety not me‚Äù, and take a deep breathe.

I posted about something similar yesterday about being on Sertaline and wanted to come off... I just have some questions!

Little back story

Been on Sertaline probably just over 2 years, because of anxiety. 

Had a ROUGH start 4-5 weeks on Sertaline. Didn‚Äôt leave my bed. Experienced the worst Depersonalisation which I hated so much, and just everything about it.

For the last 3 months I have been taking my medication inconsistently, Maybe 2 dosages(50mg) a week (7days).  I‚Äôm not sure why I wasn‚Äôt taking them Regular but I always wanted to come off them for some reason, yes it helps with my anxiety but also makes me feel different. 

Last Friday I hadn‚Äôt took one for 5 days and I didn‚Äôt even care about it, I felt fine... apart from the fact I was anxious what would happen if I didn‚Äôt take one... so I took one. Felt shitty after taking the doseage. Couple days later I feel fine again. Vice versa

5 days later (Yesterday) I took another doseage for the same reason... basically I‚Äôm nervous to come off them completely in case I experience Depersonalisation and all the weird feelings again... I never had Depersonalisation before I started taking them and only had it for the start of my medication but now it‚Äôs at the back of my mind if I stop

I had a little anxiety attack 30 mins ago and it‚Äôs because I took these doseages so irregular I think. I‚Äôd like to see how I will be off of them but I‚Äôm just nervous to try.. to see what changes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay.

4 years ago, I started taking Lexapro (10 mg), and experienced positive effects. Back in March of this year, I started to experience panic attacks frequently again, and upped my Lexapro to 20 mg.

3 Months later, the Lexapro no longer seems to be working. I went to the doctor's today and I was prescribed Cymbalta to be taken 30mg/day for the first week, while taking Lexapro at the same time, cutting my Lexapro dosage to 10 mg/day.

Do you think weening off the Lexapro in just 1 week will cause me to experience withdrawals, and will the Cymbalta (30mg for first week, then 60mg after) cause any nausea or strange side effects?

I would like to know if anyone of you guys experienced non restorative sleep due to anxiety? I have to mention that I do not have panic attacks anymore and I am not aware that I am experiencing anxiety at night. What I do know is that I am very afraid of going to university and have to deal with ""normal life"" after being unemployed for about 1 year now due to depression and generalized anxiety. I do not feel depressed anymore but the constant fatigue and weakness is so debiliating. Ive ruled out a lot of physical check-ups with no results so I expect it to be a psychological problem. But its so hard to believe because as I mentioned I do not feel nearly as depressed as Ive been some months ago. Ive done a sleep study as well and they have found out that my sleep is quite fragmented (my brain gets activated a lot more than usual while I should be asleep at night). The neurologist thinks its anxiety and I cannot exclude his theory. 

Have someone of you experienced something similar for almost a year or more due to anxiety (or depression; even if you are quite motivated and cannot believe that it could be depression anymore at all)?

In a recent chapter the author (Jane McGonigal) brought up anxiety vs excitement. To summarize: 

Anxiety and excitement are, physically speaking, the exact same emotion. Increased heart rate and alertness. Butterflies in the stomach. 

Next time you are having anxiety, try this:

Say, out loud, ""I'm excited! *Get* excited!"" Say it a few times while imagining yourself taking on the anxiety as a challenge that you are excited to step up to the plate and battle. Like a boss fight in your favorite video game. 

If that isn't enough, ask yourself what the absolute worst case scenario outcome of your situation. Now, think of the exact opposite of that worst outcome would be. For example: 

I can't go to work so I'll get fired and have to rely on assistance and charity. 

I will become rich and will give time and money to people and organizations that need support. 

It isn't a cure. Just a couple of little tricks I wanted to share! Jane McGonigal and SuperBetter have been really helpful. I'll link to her TedTalk and some other resources below.

Recently my anxiety has been stretching into my daily life, making it hard for me to feel good or engaged while I‚Äôm with my friends (who are usually my source of relief). I‚Äôm certain that if I get a job and get out of the house more My anxiety would fall to the wayside. I used to go to a therapist for free through my work but since I quit I can‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt have the money to pay out of pocket for therapy.  

How do you guys normally deal with anxiety like this?

I‚Äôve quit my job in February due to increasing frustrations with management, my anxiety has slowly been creeping up on me. It usually comes just before I go to bed where thoughts about the future and change fill my head, usually stuff like ‚Äúwhat am I going to do when my mom dies‚Äù or like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my friends.‚Äù Stuff like that, occasionally My brain likes to think of world ending or apocalyptic scenarios or think about the stuff that‚Äôs happening in the world that I can‚Äôt control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently my anxiety has been stretching into my daily life, making it hard for me to feel good or engaged while I‚Äôm with my friends (who are usually my source of relief). I‚Äôm certain that if I get a job and get out of the house more My anxiety would fall to the wayside. I used to go to a therapist for free through my work but since I quit I can‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt have the money to pay out of pocket for therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you guys normally deal with anxiety like this?

My OCD manifests itself in a range of forms and situations. For example, I have to check taps before I even leave the house and everything in my room has to be in its proper place, more recently this has also extended to driving. What I‚Äôm going to say may sound ridiculous to many but I just wanted to write all of this down and post it on here to get some help, advice and perspective.

More recently, my OCD has also extended to driving and this is clearly affecting my mental health. When I say it extends to driving what I mean by this is that I have particular issues with speed cameras, traffic lights and pedestrians.

Firstly, speed cameras, I have this fear of being caught speeding and I will say to myself when I‚Äôm driving past the camera: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm going 25mph in a 30mph zone‚Äù, but then later on I‚Äôll forget if I did that. Next, I‚Äôll have to drive round the same route to jog my memory to check whether the speed I‚Äôm going feels the same when I first passed the camera. I have googled speed limit thresholds for UK police forces and looked into speeding thresholds for prosecutions etc. I have also used Google Earth to look at speed camera locations. One thing I should note is that I have never gone over 70mph on a motorway. The issue I have is distinguishing between a 40mph and 30mph zones because these signs aren‚Äôt displayed as often as 20mph signs. So I think any issues I do have will be based around this speed. If I‚Äôm not sure I tend to drive at the lower end of this 30-40 threshold if I‚Äôm unsure.

Secondly, red lights, I have a fear that red light cameras or passing police patrols in marked and unmarked cars will catch me for jumping a red light. Again, as with the speed cameras, I will say to myself in the car that there is no chance I‚Äôll get caught because I said to myself when I was approaching: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on green‚Äù or ‚Äúthe green filter arrow is on‚Äù, but then later on I‚Äôll forget whether this was the case and then I‚Äôll have to drive back on the same route to jog my memory to see if the stopping and starting of the car feels like it did the previous time. I haven‚Äôt been stopped by a police car or unmarked police car. As of now I haven‚Äôt received any correspondence from any police force relating to speeding or jumping red lights. Although, that is only covering the driving I did up to two weeks ago (14 day notice required for NIPs).

Finally, pedestrians, I constantly observe when I‚Äôm driving and even more so when I‚Äôm reversing because I have this fear of a pedestrian walking near my car or in a blind spot and getting hurt, or when I‚Äôm driving on a road and a pedestrian or cyclist hits the side of my car by coming out of a side road too quickly. I do everything I can to observe and minimize the chances of anything happening by reversing very slowly, for example, or driving defensively. The way I see it is that if a person was hit by my car or hit whilst reversing I would certainly know about it and feel it in the driver‚Äôs seat. As yet I haven‚Äôt felt anything that could give me an issue (i.e. no marks on my car, no sound, no sound of something being struck by my vehicle). Nevertheless, I‚Äôll still have to drive the route again to check if anyone was at the scene or if there are police or ambulances etc.

I have been on medication in the past for OCD and anxiety disorders and have taken Prozac for it as prescribed by a doctor.

Now, I‚Äôve only had my car since March and I passed my test in January of this year so I really don‚Äôt need speeding tickets, red light tickets or anything else that could incur points on my license.

I have a long drive coming up (North West England to Scotland), so I really don‚Äôt need all of the above messing with my mind.

It peaked during my first semester of college; I dropped out and returned to the family home because I didn't trust myself to live alone. I wasn't looking after myself - not eating, going to classes, or even leaving my room. Things since then have improved in many ways, but I'm still not where I want to be, and I think my family really aren't helping.

My father was downright negligent during my childhood. I still remember him telling my brother and I, around about the age of eight, that he regretted having us. As I got older and started to form opinions, even the slightest disagreement with him and he'd be calling me ""stupid"" or something nasty along those lines. It'd be over petty things too, like me saying he'd forgotten to turn the porch light off or that he was trying to do something wrong on his smartphone. Worst of all, he's obsessive; he acts like someone in a permanent state of midlife crisis. He spends money recklessly, for example blowing the month's rent on a new computer for himself, and I literally had to give my parents high school grant money so we'd keep our house.

My older brother is an egotistical drug-addict who got a teenage girl pregnant, got left with the baby, and now leaves all the duties of said child to us. I reapplied for a distance-learning programme at a community college, but the day before my final exam of the year I'm being saddled with a four-year-old kid wanting entertainment instead. His illegal drug habits almost got us kicked out of our house and made homeless. Worst of all, he's incredibly aggressive; he's downright abusive towards our mother and he used to threaten me with violence growing up. I'll literally be woken up at 2am with him screaming that he's going to kill himself and it's all our faults, or that he's going to run away or do something to the child, because of something measly like our parents refusing to babysit so he can go out drinking the next day.

Finally, there's my mother. She's not at all a bad person and tried to give me everything growing up in spite of my father or brother. However, as I got into my teens and became more aware of things like how my father's bad finances stress her or how my brother upsets her with his threats, I've felt increasingly like a personal therapist. She has pretty severe health problems - both physical and mental. I spend my days worrying about her and feel unable to talk to her like people so often do with their parents. Because I don't want to add to her worries, I've always downplayed my depression and anxiety. I outright hid it for like six years, then said it was simply panic attacks, and even now I act like the medication is a great help when most days I still feel like crap.

I don't think being in this environment helps with my anxiety and depression. I dread going home sometimes because I know my father will be there and he's in a bad mood, or that it means hours of looking after a toddler, or just that I get no privacy there. I can't even call my friends anymore because my father will just barge in or I'll have a toddler pestering me (again, not her fault but I feel like her dad sometimes when she's not mine and I don't even want kids) that she's bored in the middle of it. None of them know how things are at home for me. Worst of all, and even though I know I shouldn't, I still worry about their opinions. They constantly criticised me as a teenager for how I wanted to dress, for my friends being geeks or me wanting to do geeky things like play DnD. I get anxious at having to explain to them what I'm doing whenever I leave the house, so I just don't. I barely go outside from one week to the next, unless it involves taking my brother's child to the park or something.

I have no real friends, no job because my anxiety is so bad I can't hold one down, and because of this I feel completely stuck in life. I'm not progressing as a person, not able to move out, etc. Although I don't feel as bad as those college days, probably because of the antidepressants, I'm still not happy and I don't see how I can ever be happy. I feel like I'm just going to be stuck here forever. What's the point then? Why should I even continue if there's no light at the end of the tunnel?

I've been struggling so much the past few weeks. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. 

Basically, for the past few months I've been studying for my exams, but they're over now. A couple of days before finishing my exams, I got sick (not majorly sick, it was just a cold). However, even though my illness was minor, it felt like a huge deal to me because of the timing. I had been waiting for the day I was free of exams for months and it just got me really down that it didn't turn out perfect because I was sick. As a result, my dumbass anxiety-riddled brain became obsessed with my physical health. It was all I ever thought about. Just this voice in my head for a whole week saying: ""You can't relax when you're sick. You can only enjoy yourself when you're healthy again. You have to wait until the virus is gone."" 

Anyway, the virus came and went, but the stress of constantly having that voice in my head stayed with me, and I think that made my final symptoms linger for longer. These lingering symptoms consequently made me worried that I had been immediately infected with another virus and I would have to endure the whole ordeal again. You get the gist; I started obsessively worrying about my physical health, which exacerbated my physical symptoms, which made the worrying worse. A cycle of anxiety had begun.

And now, almost a month later, my anxiety about this issue is worse than ever. I'm developing some sort of germaphobia, where I comlulsively wash and disinfect my hands to the point that it hurts, and if someone coughs near me I hold my breath until I've gotten away from them. If I feel I have been ""exposed"" to germs I will stress about it until I develop psychosomatic symptoms, which only makes the anxiety worse. I'm actually experiencing those symtoms right now. My throat is as dry as a bone, and the dryness won't go away no matter how much I drink. I haven't felt 100% well since before I first got sick, which is just so exhausting because I feel like I can't enjoy my time off until I feel completely fine. But I don't think I'll ever feel completely fine until I stop worrying, which I can't do so long as I have symptoms. God, it just feeds into itself... 

This whole thing is so stupid. My brain does this all the time; obsessively and uncontrollably worries about something until it becomes an issue entirely disproportionate to reality. But this particular instance is more debilitating than the others because we come into contact with germs every day. I'm struggling more than I ever have before, and I know my anxiety is at the heart of it. I'm just so, so tired. It feels like I've been constantly stressed for a month now. How can something have escalated to this extent in a matter of a few weeks? Why is my brain like this? 

I'm really just upset and wanted to share this with people who might understand. I hope we can all feel better soon, and if anyone has any experience with something like this, let me know!

Once I entered high school, this changed a bit. I‚Äôm more talkative and enjoy making new friends. My trick is to make friends with those who are a little more quiet like myself (works every time).

Despite progressing, there are still some things I wish i can change. For example: in middle school I would experience sadness out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it and because of this I would harm myself. My mom found out and got really mad at me which lead me to stop. Up until then, I still get waves of sadness for no reason which has lead me to cry a lot. I would say I am more sensitive than others as in little things hurt my feelings and I still have trouble speaking up, especially to those people who do hurt my feelings. To avoid this, I just surround myself with positive people. 

Until recently, I got my first job at Target! I am currently a cashier. Starting there has given me anxiety. Usually this occurs the morning before work, the night before, or sometimes during my shift when I have a question or am pushed to do something new. Recently on Saturday, on my way to work, I had a panic attack. My mom was driving me and I told her that I don‚Äôt feel too good. I explained how nervous I am and how my breathing is a bit off. She began yelling at me and asking why I‚Äôm feeling this way. While crying and trying to control my breathing, I explained it‚Äôs probably because this is my first job. She proceeded to get mad at me for not telling her sooner and stating that i never share my feelings with the family. 

To be fair, i don‚Äôt speak to my family about my mental health because i feel as if they will not take me seriously. Whenever I am feeling down and quiet, they just assume I am in a bad mood and get mad at me for it. This is why I went to college 9 hours away from my house because I wanted time to myself. Moreover, my family majority of the time is arguing and everything makes me feel uncomfortable. 

I want to continue working at Target because in the past, i tended to give up on things that made me feel this way. I don‚Äôt want to give up since this is my first job and will hopefully add experience and allow me to grow confidence.

Over a year ago something snapped in me that sent me into this fucked up world inside my own head. I‚Äôd never been there before, I‚Äôd never experienced panic and anxiety before to the extent that I was. I was in and out of doctors offices, hospitals, thinking I was dying, trying to get help but not trying to get ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù as my life just couldn‚Äôt handle a hospitalization for ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù. A doctor prescribed me Prozac, and that sucked complete ass and I couldn‚Äôt handle it. Then came the Lexapro but I didn‚Äôt even bother. 

I became manic one day and nearly lost my shit completely. Out of nowhere, with no warning I was jittery and felt like I couldn‚Äôt slow down. I felt like I could literally come right out of my skin. By the end I was shaking and crying and near screaming. The only help I could receive was from my parents so my mother popped a Klonopin in my mouth and I had my first experience with (what I consider) the proper medication for me. It was great until it wore off.

Here I am, over a year later and I‚Äôm still struggling off and on with this bullshit. Not nearly as frequently as before. I thought I had developed some healthy coping mechanisms along the way. I have an actual psychiatric practitioner who has prescribed me both Seroquel (which I‚Äôm too afraid to take, I know the lasting effects) and Ativan. If I‚Äôm lucky, I pre-medicate myself with a few Ativan and I have a good day/night. If I‚Äôm unlucky like tonight none of that fucking matters and I‚Äôm sitting on my couch obsessing over my heart rate‚Äîis it still beating, why is it so fast, why won‚Äôt it slow down, my blood pressure is probably high-let me check it-my blood pressure IS high‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîpanic panic panic. I‚Äôve been checked out recently for any true physical abnormalities and nothing. It‚Äôs ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù. Fuck, how many times I‚Äôve heard this phrase...

This shit sucks. It literally sucks any bit of sanity I have left every time I have an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù. I want to crawl into bed every time but then I‚Äôm left alone with my thoughts and instead of trying to be a functioning adult I‚Äôm just lying down. Some days I wish I could just be medicated heavily and be calm. But I can‚Äôt. I have a job to do, people to care for, bills to pay.

Since that day I had been over analyzing, almost obsessively, looking up all my symptoms, pains, and bumps. 

This got to a point where it was the only thing I was doing. I would sit and read endless articles about random, deadly body problems and immediately start feeling the symptoms of these. Waiting at lights, at the dinner table, watching tv, anytime my hands became free of what I was doing, I was on my phone looking up symptoms. I have been to the doctor three times this month only for them to tell me that I am in perfect health, but I didn‚Äôt believe them. 

Checking my symptoms like this was causing me anxiety attacks that would also make me feel physical symptoms like chest tightness, a lump in my throat, and tremors, prolonging the anxiety attacks for 1-3 hours everyday for 2 weeks straight. Panic attacks were random but very frequent, a couple times a week. This all started to make sense when finally I stumbled upon Hypochondria on google. I knew I had found the answer to what was making me feel like I was dying everyday. 

All of the pains I had been feeling were caused by my own anxiety. The tremors had caused a muscle contraction in my neck, giving me daily tension headaches that I constantly thought was an aneurysm. The pain in my lungs was in fact not due to blood clots/embolisms caused by Nuva ring, but instead I had strained the muscles in my back due to the tremors, making my lungs feel as if they hurt but it‚Äôs simply my muscles pulling on my ribs. My heart palpitations were not heart attacks, it was increased heart rate due to my anxiety. The tingling in my arm was not a stroke, this is also caused by the contracted muscle in my neck. The swollen lymph nodes in my neck are not cancer, but instead I am fighting a case of sinusitis. 

Until today, having it confirmed by my psychiatrist that I in fact have Hypochondria, possible somatic symptom disorder, and OCD, I was not able to calm down or believe that I wasn‚Äôt dying. I didn‚Äôt even believe the doctors when they told me my vitals, EKGs, and Blood tests all came back normal every time.

I‚Äôm a 17 y/o girl.

The fact is that since then I‚Äôve been asked to be in a relationship 3 times

The first time was with a classmate.
Every time he brought up the topic I would say I wasn‚Äôt interested but felt really bad about it and had a huge weight in my chest, then later felt like crying in the bathroom without a reason. This went on for all the year.

The second time was with a classmate friend, though indirectly he said that I was liked by one of his friends, I gently declined because I was started to feeling sick about it.

The last one was a week ago.
A boy messages me on Instagram saying that he always wanted to talk to me and that he saw me at the bus station everyday and was interested in me.

With the last one I felt even worse than the other 2, I don‚Äôt know why.
I started panicking and feeling sick and wanted to cry again.
Then I had a really uncomfortable sensation the entire week.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been friends with this group for a various amount of time. I have been friends with Jack \[22M\], and Carol \[23F\] for about 5 years now, and Anna \[24F\] and Ben \[29M\] for 2 years now. I also currently share a house with Ben and Anna.

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder, and have been on medication for that ever since. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with depression, and had my medications switched. I ran out of the new medication while in the middle of midterms and finishing up my semester at school, and by the time I had time to go back to my doctor, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been on any medication for over a month and felt a lot better than I had in awhile, so I made the decision to stay off any medication and try to deal with things on my own. For about 4 months I had been dealing with things pretty well, but then I noticed that I was finding things a bit harder than they had been, and had been in open communication with my friends about this.

&amp;#x200B;

It was in May that there started to be problems between us. I had a birthday party at my parents house which was about a 30-45 min drive outside of where we live. They have all been there multiple times, and I have had my birthday there the past few years. When it came time for people to start showing up, none of them were there. When I reached out to them to see why they weren‚Äôt there yet, there was a lot of run-around and pointing fingers at other people before I finally found out that they had all been up until 430AM the night before, and Carol was still sleeping (after 2PM when the party started at 1PM), and no one could wake her up. When I tried explaining to them why I was upset, I was told that I had no reason to be upset, and that they were doing me a favor by driving all the way out there for my birthday. Once they did arrive (over 5 hours late), not one person apologized, and then decided to do their own thing and said no to everything I suggested we do/play.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a conversation with Carol and Jack about it, and thought that the air was cleared. As the weeks went by there were conversations about things that happened that made me think that they were annoyed with me, but when I asked them point blank, I was always told that things were fine, that no one was mad, and that I was just reading into things too much.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, my anxiety has begun to get worse, and I had already made an appointment with my doctor but didn‚Äôt feel the need to relay that to any of them. Then, there was an issue with my roommate Anna, and a miscommunication about something I ate in the fridge that I thought was part of our group grocery. Since I couldn‚Äôt replace it right away, I left her money, but then it blew up to where I was dismissing her feelings because I told her that she was making it into a bigger deal than what it was because she was being unreasonable by saying we needed to buy our own groceries and such, simply because I ate something (we have a small fridge so it‚Äôs just not feasible for there to be multiples of a lot of things).

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few days later, while I am eating dinner in our living room with all of us, the tv is shut off, and they start talking to me. They had appointed Ben to be the ‚Äúmediator‚Äù, and immediately he starts off talking about how they need to tell me about how my actions have been affecting them and how I need to realize that if I keep doing what I am doing I am not going to have any friends. I immediately start having a panic attack, and told them that this was not the time and I did not want to do that, and then was told that I didn‚Äôt have a choice if I wanted to keep my friends. There were several things brought up, such as how me being upset about my birthday was unreasonable and made them feel like bad friends, and that the interactions between us when I had pointblank asked them if there was a problem and they told me no, there really was a problem and no one would talk to me about it. There was also the comment about how their goal was to ‚Äúget me back on my meds‚Äù and understand how upset they are with me.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have had 2 panic attacks, and have tried getting up but kept getting told to sit back down. It was when Ben made the comment about how if he had friends like me that he would not be friends with them (which I thought we were friends but I guess not). This is the point that I get up and walk out. I go to my room, try making some phone calls to find someone to get me out of there (I don‚Äôt have a car), but am not able to reach anyone. Carol comes up to talk to me to tell me she‚Äôs sorry and that she feels bad about everything and realizes this was a bad idea, but then Anna comes in to tell me that if I don‚Äôt go back downstairs then I won‚Äôt have any friends left. I simply replied okay, and told her to leave me alone, which she didn‚Äôt. Eventually I went back down stairs after I had calmed down a bit just to get everyone to leave, and just kinda detached myself from what was happening and stopped caring about what they were saying so I wouldn‚Äôt have another anxiety attack. I was told that I needed to have bi-weekly meetings with them to let them know about what my doctor was saying, and that if I didn‚Äôt work towards getting better then they weren‚Äôt going to be friends with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I have found out a lot more about what led up to this. None of them have any training what so ever in relation to mental health. Also, none of them have ever dealt with anyone with depression or anxiety until me. Anna had talked to another one of my close friends (lets call her Angela) about what was going on with me before this happened (and this friend is trained in things related to this), but made it seem like she was just going to talk to me one on one. It was a few days ago that I learned that she told the rest of the group that she had gotten the okay from Angela, when in fact she hadn‚Äôt. Anna also told everyone that she had talked to my mother about what they were going to do the day before, which was also a lie. I also learned that they had a group chat talking about me, and had been sharing specific conversations between us, that I thought were private ones.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past few days I have tried talking to all of them to explain how what they did was beyond fucked up, and that they have actually made things 100% worse for me because my anxiety is now through the roof, I‚Äôve had at least 1 panic attack a day, and feel so isolated and uncomfortable in my own home. Carol and Jack were receptive, and that they are sorry for making me feel that way. Anna was just combative, and told me that she was doing what she thought was best, and didn‚Äôt appreciate me dismissing her feelings and needed to make it known. Yet, not a single one of them has apologized for actually doing it, and none of them have admitted just how fucked up what they did was. They just keep saying ‚Äúwell you need to think about how hard it was on us, and we were coming from a place of concern and didn‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am at the point of trying to figure out if this is something to be upset about even though they were ‚Äúcoming from a good place‚Äù (I think it is, but they have told me otherwise). Also, are these friendships even salvageable at this point, because right now I don‚Äôt trust any of them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My friends, who are not trained medical professions, decided to hold an intervention to tell me about how I‚Äôm being a bad friend due to my depression, and that I needed to know how it was affecting them. Now I don‚Äôt know if these friendships are salvageable and if I have a reason to be upset.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a throwaway because people I know also know my reddit handle.&lt;/p&gt;

There were several things brought up, such as how me being upset about my birthday was unreasonable and made them feel like bad friends, and that the interactions between us when I had pointblank asked them if there was a problem and they told me no, there really was a problem and no one would talk to me about it. There was also the comment about how their goal was to ‚Äúget me back on my meds‚Äù and understand how upset they are with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I have had 2 panic attacks, and have tried getting up but kept getting told to sit back down. It was when Ben made the comment about how if he had friends like me that he would not be friends with them (which I thought we were friends but I guess not). This is the point that I get up and walk out. I go to my room, try making some phone calls to find someone to get me out of there (I don‚Äôt have a car), but am not able to reach anyone. Carol comes up to talk to me to tell me she‚Äôs sorry and that she feels bad about everything and realizes this was a bad idea, but then Anna comes in to tell me that if I don‚Äôt go back downstairs then I won‚Äôt have any friends left. I simply replied okay, and told her to leave me alone, which she didn‚Äôt. Eventually I went back down stairs after I had calmed down a bit just to get everyone to leave, and just kinda detached myself from what was happening and stopped caring about what they were saying so I wouldn‚Äôt have another anxiety attack. I was told that I needed to have bi-weekly meetings with them to let them know about what my doctor was saying, and that if I didn‚Äôt work towards getting better then they weren‚Äôt going to be friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have found out a lot more about what led up to this. None of them have any training what so ever in relation to mental health. Also, none of them have ever dealt with anyone with depression or anxiety until me. Anna had talked to another one of my close friends (lets call her Angela) about what was going on with me before this happened (and this friend is trained in things related to this), but made it seem like she was just going to talk to me one on one. It was a few days ago that I learned that she told the rest of the group that she had gotten the okay from Angela, when in fact she hadn‚Äôt. Anna also told everyone that she had talked to my mother about what they were going to do the day before, which was also a lie. I also learned that they had a group chat talking about me, and had been sharing specific conversations between us, that I thought were private ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I have tried talking to all of them to explain how what they did was beyond fucked up, and that they have actually made things 100% worse for me because my anxiety is now through the roof, I‚Äôve had at least 1 panic attack a day, and feel so isolated and uncomfortable in my own home. Carol and Jack were receptive, and that they are sorry for making me feel that way. Anna was just combative, and told me that she was doing what she thought was best, and didn‚Äôt appreciate me dismissing her feelings and needed to make it known. Yet, not a single one of them has apologized for actually doing it, and none of them have admitted just how fucked up what they did was. They just keep saying ‚Äúwell you need to think about how hard it was on us, and we were coming from a place of concern and didn‚Äôt know what else to do.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I am at the point of trying to figure out if this is something to be upset about even though they were ‚Äúcoming from a good place‚Äù (I think it is, but they have told me otherwise). Also, are these friendships even salvageable at this point, because right now I don‚Äôt trust any of them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: My friends, who are not trained medical professions, decided to hold an intervention to tell me about how I‚Äôm being a bad friend due to my depression, and that I needed to know how it was affecting them. Now I don‚Äôt know if these friendships are salvageable and if I have a reason to be upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week has been awful in terms of panic attacks. I&amp;#39;ve been waking up super early &amp;amp; completely freaking out for no reason. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder in addition to depression &amp;amp; have been working hard on maintaining my treatment, taking my meds &amp;amp; trying to participate in life since being diagnosed in 2013. There have not been any major life changes, no distressing news, I&amp;#39;m not worried about bills for a change - yet lately every day I wake up filled with dread, an inability to move, repetitive phrases or songs I dislike running rampant in my brain. I get incredibly nauseas (I&amp;#39;m not pregnant) &amp;amp; sometimes inadvertently hold my breath (which does not help). &lt;/p&gt;

I've tried pills, many of them, and nothing has worked. I've tried EMDR, nothing. Nuero feedback, the worker told me my brain didnt adapt to it. The only thing i really have left to try is shock therapy. It feels like none of these doctors care, and even if they do, dont get whats really going on.

It hasnt always been this bad, I had some anxiety, an occasional panic attack, but I still moved to a new city and got a job, a girlfriend, my own place. The past year has been rough. After a terrible panic attack, bordering on psychosis, i had to move back in with my parents. That was a year ago and nothing has changed, in fact it has gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I despise the people that say, if you need help, get it, there are so many resources out there. They obviously havent been through what we&amp;#39;eve been through. Sure there&amp;#39;s resources, a psychiatrist that takes 3 months to get into, a neurologist that takes 6, multiple therapists who dont click with you. I&amp;#39;ve tried pills, many of them, and nothing has worked. I&amp;#39;ve tried EMDR, nothing. Nuero feedback, the worker told me my brain didnt adapt to it. The only thing i really have left to try is shock therapy. It feels like none of these doctors care, and even if they do, dont get whats really going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the chain of anxiety growing tighter around my neck. While I used to be able to travel, go to dinners, go on dates, now i can barely leave my house. I fear that I will never meet anyone again, and my whole life will be an empty lonley hole. I feel like a dog on one of those polls in your back yard, with minimal slack before my leash of anxiety pulls me back. Sometimes, I wonder if im the only one with problems this bad. Other people &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; anxiety but they still travel to europe, have jobs and good relationships. Will it ever get better I wonder? Will this disease slowly eat away at my brain, my confidence, my life until there is nothing left? I&amp;#39;m at a loss right now, and I really dont know what to do. Perhaps there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but i see no brightness, only the cold darkness stretching miles.&lt;/p&gt;

Finished my first year of college, head back in August. Have a good-paying summer job, good grades, good friends. But right now, I'm having an existential crisis about the future.

About two weeks ago, I read the infamous ""CO¬≤ in the atmosphere now 415 parts per million, an all-time-high"" article and then started researching climate change and the grim outlook for the future. They say society will end by 2050 if drastic measures are not taken immediately. Worse news comes out every day, from 40‚Å∞ above-normal temps melting Greenland's ice sheets to microbes in feedback loops to cruise ships belching pollution into the atmosphere to 10 companies contributing 70% of gas emissions and not giving a fuck about it to everything else.
It all feels so useless sometimes. What's the point of going to college or paying off my student loans or getting married and having kids (something I've wanted to do my entire life very much) if everything as I know it is going to go away in fifty years (or sooner)?

There isn't even anything I can really do to stop it. No matter how many lights I turn off, how much I compost, how much I try to have a green life free of emissions, it won't even make a microscopic dent in helping our hothouse of a planet.

Sure, I can vote for politicians that make flashy promises about green energy and how we can fix everything by using alternative energy and sucking the CO¬≤ out of the air, but there's no guarantee that anything's going to be carried out in full. To hear some scientists tell it, even if we manage to cut almost all carbon emissions the average global temperature is still going to go up for a long, long time before it even thinks about going down again. And the date that everything is supposed to go to shit keeps moving up a year or so every day, it seems like.

Everyone in power now, from the administration to leaders of gas companies, only care about the now and not what will happen soon. They don't cut emissions. They don't think about their children or their grandchildren or their great-grandchildren. ""Who cares if the planet's dying and we're a major cause of it? Q3 profits need to be up!"" I don't want my future decided by a group of rich billionaires who won't be around to see the consequences of their greed and selfishness.

I've spent the last two weeks in a funk. I go to work, get off, go home, have dinner with my mom, watch tv for two hours, go to bed, rinse, repeat. The weekends only give me more time to worry about everything. It seems like all I can do is just sit here and hope action is taken soon or watch as society, my way of life, and the hopes and dreams I had of the future crumble around me. Just once, I want to start a new day, look at my news feed, and see *good* news about the planet's future and climate.

I'm so tired of thinking about this. Having this giant cloud of worry over me everywhere I go about the future and how everything is fucked if we don't start right away. I just want to wake up in a world tomorrow where everything is normal again and I can go through my day-to-day life, save money, graduate college, get a good-paying job, find someone I love and start a family with them, watch my kids grow up, send them off to college, retire myself, and die peacefully.

So here it goes: I'm a 31-year old married, working professional and I've suffered from anxiety for much of my adult life. I currently take Venefelaxine 75mg/daily. When my wife and I first started dating, and then moved in together, I didn't dread being away from her. I'd get things done around the house when she went to work, and I'd look forward to coming home to her when I'd work. Now, I absolutely dread it when she leaves for work and I'm off, or vice versa. I think about it on our days off and I've called off sick or have taken LOA's in order to be home with her. My anxiety has affected my work life in the past, but only recently has it become far more noticeable now that I have a mortgage and other household expenses to worry about.

‚Äã

I have started comparing my schedule with my wife's and marked the days off we have together in my calendar so I know what to look forward to.

‚Äã

I don't particularly love my present job, or the long hours (12-hour shifts) but I am working on finishing up my masters and I am constantly thinking about what I'm going to look into getting into once I'm done (job wise). Nothing much I can do about that for the next 8 months or so.

‚Äã

I'm not sure where this separation type anxiety stems from, but I do remember having extreme difficulties when my parents would leave me with a grandparent or sitter in the past (to go on vacation, to work, etc). I also remember experiencing anxiety/depression as a young adult (18-21ish) when my parents would leave for a vacation together.

‚Äã

My wife is extremely supportive and is well aware of my struggles, but I'd love nothing more than to be able to go through periods of separation due to work just like every other couple, and not suffer immensely. I'd love to whole-heartedly enjoy our days off together, without becoming anxious over the days ahead where we will be separated.

I'm very new to it, so I've learned only a small amount of what I'll eventually learn.

One of the things we talked about is my anxiety induced insomnia and how that can be one of the harder issues related to anxiety.

My therapist suggested reading to stop my mind from thinking about work, money, interpersonal tensions, etc.. but it won't work for me because I'm basically a book addict. If I read a book at night and if it even vaguely captures my interest (most books), I'll stay up till morning reading. It's really my only hobby and I read A LOT of books a year. I also listen to audiobooks.

So I told him I already do this, except I read things I've already read (or listened to if it's an audiobook) so that I don't get sucked into a book and stay up all night. 

He said this wasn't the best idea as my mind can stay focused on other things if the book doesn't capture my full attention. And that makes sense.

So... What I did, after contemplating the rationale behind this idea, is download a language learning app (Duolingo). And now, throughout the day, if I start to feel myself getting unhealthy levels of anxiety, I open the app and take some lessons. 

It works amazingly well for most situations. If I've let the anxiety get too bad, I can't concentrate and it doesn't work. But I've been learning how to identify things that cause my severe anxiety attacks and am getting better at stopping whatever I'm doing early enough to prevent it from getting any higher.

Learning a language is hard work that takes a ton of brain power. Especially for me as I have never learned a second language. So if I really get into it, my mind stops racing and taking a few lessons truly makes it so that I'm not letting myself get worked up.

I'm learning Spanish. But they have all sorts of languages available to learn. So sometimes I'll start a lesson in High Valarian which is a linguist 'Created Language' that was created for Game of Thrones.

It's totally silly, but sometimes sillyness is a good thing. I exaggerate the language's inflections and accents so that it will sometimes make me laugh. But because it's an actual language with everything a language needs to be used to communicate effectively... It's hard work.

I rarely need the sillyness of High Valarian and am actually making tremendous strides with Spanish. Which is good because I married a Mexican girl and she only speaks Spanish with my kids so that they're bilingual. So I'm somewhat emersed in the language at home, and I'm an architect so my job sites are mostly built by Mexican crews who speak Spanish with each other.

It's been amazing. Not only am I learning a second language, but in doing so I'm addressing a major mental issue in a very positive and effective way.

I just thought I'd share my experiences since you fine people have helped me a lot in the past when I was first diagnosed and had to start dealing with something as debilitating as Severe Panic Disorder.

Here are a few examples:
- Imagine sitting in a restaurant. I have no clue if biting the pieces off my easily bitable piece of meat is a decent enough thing to do or if that's just not a decent way of eating for a restaurant?

- If I have way of passing at a pedestrian crossing and a few parents on their bikes barely made it in front of me I would still cut their kids behind them off because ""Hey, I had way of passage!"" 
Same with old people wanting to go through a door. ""Sorry old man, this guy was here 0.1 sec before you ;)""

- When a friend comes over I'll always be thinking along the lines of ""Am I showing enough interest?"" ""Am I letting him speak enough?"" ""What question should I ask next?"" It's like a damn interview.

- Is this sack of nuts I happened to have with me in my bag acceptable to eat on this terrace or should I leave it for later?

- When I asked a girl if she liked wine she jokingly said ""Yeah I even shower in it!"" on which I replied: ""Oh yeah, I could already smell something off..""
Basically saying she smelled. (Of wine I meant but still)

- My 6 year old niece asked who I had a crush on, I said ""You!"". Now im scared that she thinks having a crush on your family is okay.

- I work as a bartender and some celebrities came and ordered drinks and said ""Do we get them for free since we're famous?"" On which I replied: ""Well, you're famous so don't you have enough money already?"" They got shocked and walked away. I'm a guy representing that bar!!

- 1 or 3 kisses when I meet a familymember? ""Lets do exactly the opposite of what they are going for ;)""

Hey everyone, I'm back again :/

Ok, so, since my health anxiety really kicked in a few months ago I've stopped working out/running/being active and started sitting and laying on the couch watching youtube most days for multiple house. My posture has taken a hit from this. Anyway, the past month I've been trying to get out again and take walks around the neighborhood when I feel up to it. I got to the point where I was out walking almost everyday for at least an hour even running around playing soccer with my family last week.

So two days ago I decided to do a little test run to see how unfit I was. This wasn't the first time I'd done this just the most recent. It was just a quarter mile at jogging pace but I was prepared for my lungs to burn and my body to feel tired, instead I felt a the burning right in the center of my chest next to my heart. This wasnt what I was expecting and I can't remember ever feeling this particular feeling before. This freaked me out quite a bit. I figured it was something wrong with my heart or lungs or maybe some kind of clot or something. It's been two days and the feeling sorta comes and goes but it hasn't gone away completely yet. I'm now to scared to be active again and I think I'll have a heart attack if I do. This has now combined with the small chest pain over my heart ive been feeling on and off for months. It's causing me to spiral. I dreamt last night about having the pain and burning but in the dream it was much worse and I woke up in a panic about it and coundlt stop shaking for half an hour.

I've tried talking myself down from it being something serious. I've tried figuring out what could be causing it but nothing is helping me calm down so I figured maybe someone here has dealt with something like this and has some words of advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-post from &lt;a href=""/r/healthanxiety""&gt;r/healthanxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So here it goes: I'm a 31-year old married, working professional and I've suffered from anxiety for much of my adult life. I currently take Venefelaxine 75mg/daily. When my wife and I first started dating, and then moved in together, I didn't dread being away from her. I'd get things done around the house when she went to work, and I'd look forward to coming home to her when I'd work. Now, I absolutely dread it when she leaves for work and I'm off, or vice versa. I think about it on our days off and I've called off sick or have taken LOA's in order to be home with her. My anxiety has affected my work life in the past, but only recently has it become far more noticeable now that I have a mortgage and other household expenses to worry about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have started comparing my schedule with my wife's and marked the days off we have together in my calendar so I know what to look forward to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't particularly love my present job, or the long hours (12-hour shifts) but I am working on finishing up my masters and I am constantly thinking about what I'm going to look into getting into once I'm done (job wise). Nothing much I can do about that for the next 8 months or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where this separation type anxiety stems from, but I do remember having extreme difficulties when my parents would leave me with a grandparent or sitter in the past (to go on vacation, to work, etc). I also remember experiencing anxiety/depression as a young adult (18-21ish) when my parents would leave for a vacation together. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is extremely supportive and is well aware of my struggles, but I'd love nothing more than to be able to go through periods of separation due to work just like every other couple, and not suffer immensely. I'd love to whole-heartedly enjoy our days off together, without becoming anxious over the days ahead where we will be separated. It's emotionally and physically exhausting.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

2 being silent and not able to communicate often not able to walk
3 being her right arm shakes uncontrollably and is all but having a fit

This is exhausting for her and I‚Äôve learned that it leaves me with a 48 hour hangover of simply being on edge. Will it happen again? It seems to come out of no where (to me), very very fast.

Can anyone here relate to this at all? We are moving House this weekend to try and find somewhere quieter. What shall we expect? If we move place and it is quiet, will the attacks continue? Medication is not really an option (au natural-ish and all), she believes it numbs and does not fix. 

These are all lessons which we will no doubt learn from but it‚Äôs pretty scary now and the attacks seem to happen on differing  levels of the spectrum slightly more often on average than once every other day!

(Long-Post).
I‚Äôm a 30yo guy with a lot of stress on my mind.
I recently accepted the idea that I might suffer from a form of Anxiety and I need you guys to tell me if you relate to my problems.

Here it goes:

I have been a little stressed, anxious, afraid since a child. My family environment was a mess with parents fighting all my life since I left at 19.
Alcohol was a daily thing in my family plus broken things, shouting and everything that comes with this ‚Äútypical‚Äù family lifestyle.

I kind of internalized all this insecurity, uncertainty that dominated all my childhood and teen years.
It made me suspicious and scared and broke my self-esteem, always felt inferior to other people with normal families.

I have blocked out pretty much all my memories from that part of my life and built lots of anger and self-hatred, tattooed myself, etc.

At some point I met my SO that helped me question and address my feelings for the first time (26).

Since then, I was used to fall into a trance-state for minutes or hours when the negative emotions would come at me in waves, I would become distant from the surroundings and numb and just stood still trying to block out the feelings.

Now, I let them ‚Äúexist‚Äù even though they are unpleasant. I managed to forgive my family and trying to work out the feelings and emotions I experience.

The problem is, I am very sensitive when it comes to health (mental health too), I get trapped and scared in an anxious state of ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm broken?‚Äù, I obsessively search the internet and lose hours trying to find diagnostics and reassure myself that I‚Äôm in fact ok.

I obsessed about having cancer, hiv, leukemia, etc.
Now the fear is schizophrenia (since my brother was diagnosed a month ago with this illness).
I cannot convince myself that I‚Äôm ok and I don‚Äôt have to be like him. I get paranoid of bodily sensations, sounds or anything that might ‚Äúprove‚Äù I am schizophrenic too.
I cannot say that I ever hallucinated, saw weird things, heard weird things of heard voices.

The only voice in my head is me coming up with scenarios arguing with relatives or friends, or strangers. But it‚Äôs always me, I imagine how I tell things to my brother, or my mother, or whatever.
I imagine what I should have said or what I should say. I get very anxious that this might be a sign of schizophrenia.

Sometimes when I am stressed I wake up in the morning with a rushing mind - tens of thoughts about random things pop-up in my head and move fast from one to another, sometimes they are not related to one another. It however drains my energy.

Other times I panic of not doing things I should and the feelings make me incapacitated hence ads even more stress.

I worry about worrying, I stress about being stressed. I don‚Äôt want to be schizophrenic, I don‚Äôt want to have cancer, I don‚Äôt want to die.

I also stress about plenty of other minor things and simply cannot relax, I just cannot keep my mind calm.

When I worry about being schizophrenic, I enter a weird state where I am hyper vigilant, I scan my body, my mind, my surroundings, any sign, any sound, any thought that might prove its true.

I have small appetite and always had so I am the edge of underweight. The amount of worry and stress interferes with my appetite and sleep and all this tiredness makes me even more agitated.

Is this anxiety or what is it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!

So I need some guidance. I started a new job in my career field that I am very thankful for. However, I‚Äôve always been an extremely anxious person - generalized, health related, social, etc. I‚Äôve had periods of very strong anxiety that is daily and periods of clearness where I love life. I am now in a very dark place. A couple months ago, I went on a trip to Miami. The flying there had me on edge and when we got to Miami I had a couple strong drinks that hit me funny - I ended up panicking and was worried I was dying.

Later during that trip, we went to a music festival amongst tens of thousands of people. During a performance I was very excited to see, I began having a panic attack. I toughed  it out since it was something I was looking forward to for a year, even though I felt on the verge of throwing up or fainting, legs were jello and I felt like I was going to lose control.

I got home and went back to work and about two weeks later, I was talking to my supervisor. I‚Äôve always needed glasses for an astigmatism but did not have them that day - I was also hungover from the previous night (stupid, I know). So I became fixated on my natural blur in vision and began panicking that I was having a vertigo attack from the alcohol the night before. Well then I started getting warm, heart racing and unsteady. I went to my desk and was freaking out that I nearly passed out.

Now every day is a struggle. I can‚Äôt get it off my mind that I‚Äôll faint one of these times. Also, I constantly feel a worry that I‚Äôm going to go insane and lose my job, or make a fool of myself, or that I can no longer perform under pressure. I‚Äôm a shell of myself to say the least.

During meetings I‚Äôll start to panic and get the cold sweats/faint/disassociated feelings. While simply talking to coworkers. I need this to stop or I‚Äôm actually going to lose my job and everything I‚Äôve worked for - I‚Äôll be up for a management role and there‚Äôs no way I can perform such duties like this.

I visited a psychiatrist yesterday who prescribed me Zoloft 50mg and propranolol 10mg. The Zoloft has made very nauseated today, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs contributing to my anxiety and panic. Will this help my panic attacks? Does anyone have these similar vasovagal attacks? What the hell do I do - I honestly can‚Äôt live life like this anymore. I‚Äôve tried all the breathing and calming techniques and nothing‚Äôs working. Do I keep waiting on the meds to kick in?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I need some guidance. I started a new job in my career field that I am very thankful for. However, I‚Äôve always been an extremely anxious person - generalized, health related, social, etc. I‚Äôve had periods of very strong anxiety that is daily and periods of clearness where I love life. I am now in a very dark place. A couple months ago, I went on a trip to Miami. The flying there had me on edge and when we got to Miami I had a couple strong drinks that hit me funny - I ended up panicking and was worried I was dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later during that trip, we went to a music festival amongst tens of thousands of people. During a performance I was very excited to see, I began having a panic attack. I toughed  it out since it was something I was looking forward to for a year, even though I felt on the verge of throwing up or fainting, legs were jello and I felt like I was going to lose control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home and went back to work and about two weeks later, I was talking to my supervisor. I‚Äôve always needed glasses for an astigmatism but did not have them that day - I was also hungover from the previous night (stupid, I know). So I became fixated on my natural blur in vision and began panicking that I was having a vertigo attack from the alcohol the night before. Well then I started getting warm, heart racing and unsteady. I went to my desk and was freaking out that I nearly passed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now every day is a struggle. I can‚Äôt get it off my mind that I‚Äôll faint one of these times. Also, I constantly feel a worry that I‚Äôm going to go insane and lose my job, or make a fool of myself, or that I can no longer perform under pressure. I‚Äôm a shell of myself to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During meetings I‚Äôll start to panic and get the cold sweats/faint/disassociated feelings. While simply talking to coworkers. I need this to stop or I‚Äôm actually going to lose my job and everything I‚Äôve worked for - I‚Äôll be up for a management role and there‚Äôs no way I can perform such duties like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited a psychiatrist yesterday who prescribed me Zoloft 50mg and propranolol 10mg.

Also the fact that I‚Äôve been seeing the NP and now I‚Äôve got the actual Drs attention. That seems disturbing. I had benign polyps over ten years ago and routinely get the type of little ovarian cysts that stay fairly small and come and go with my period but nothing serious.

I procrastinated all the time and I was immersed in doing so for it was my way of hurting myself, I took my frustration and anger towards everything around me on myself. Even if I wanted to read I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do so and I would get extremely anxious and nauseous at the thought of reading because I was intimidated by it I thought I wouldn‚Äôt understand the material well enough like everyone else. Then I joined a reading club online and that ignited my love for seeking knowledge and reading again but then that became an obsession and ocd started to kick off. I felt that I needed to read and learn everything all at once and the comparison and feelings of inferiority never stopped but were even stronger. now I‚Äôm trying to accept that it‚Äôs okay to not to know it‚Äôs okay to be imperfect. I‚Äôm back to reading and studying now and that‚Äôs a part of my self improvement plan. But the main obstacles I always face are shame and insecurity. I find that when I don‚Äôt stick to my plan or if I‚Äôm one hour late or if I procrastinate a bit my feelings of shame weigh me down I feel like I‚Äôm the scum of the earth and even when I do follow my plan I still feel like I‚Äôm not working enough and that I‚Äôm doing something wrong. And if don‚Äôt do something on the plan I feel the need to repeat my thoughts over and over to be reassured that I will do it later. i don‚Äôt recall the last time I was ever satisfied with anything I‚Äôve done. I always feel like something is missing I‚Äôm never happy. I can‚Äôt go to therapy and I know I‚Äôm in desperate need for it and for medication but It‚Äôs not an option whatsoever. I thought of meditating but still it feels like it is not enough and I need to do more. I wanna heal myself and untangle my deep rooted beliefs about me. I wanna gain my trust and confidence in myself back but I don‚Äôt know how to do so, any tips? Also, how do you distinguish between anxious obsessive thoughts and regular ones?&lt;/p&gt;

I have tried searching for information about my fears but surprisingly I have found none, which is why I have decided to post this.

For the last 5 months I've had mild depression, anxiety and an existential crisis. For the last two months I've been having this thought, this fear, of being deceived by an evil higher power, and that this being has left hints throughout the world for me to find to make me slowly realize that it is all fake and for me to slowly become insane and ultimately kill myself. What if everyone and everything around me is fake and just put there to deceive me?

This have made me wonder if I am psychotic, delusional or have schizophrenia. The thing is that I don't necessarily believe in it, but at the same time I don't necessarily NOT believe it. I have a fear that it MIGHT be true, and this is enough for me to question everything and everyone around me, which makes me emotionally disconnected from the world.

Also, it makes me feel lonely because, you know, everyone else would not be real and just put there to make the world seem real enough for me to initially believe it is and to make the process of me going insane slow and painful.

This loneliness and this entire scenario make me feel depressed, trapped, helpless and hopeless, and it induces intrusive thoughts of suicide. But, I don't want to commit suicide, but by the nature of this fear I am starting to fear that it is my fate to commit suicide (once I become insane enough).

I am seeing a psychologist for my depression and I've told her parts of this fear, and I might see a psychiatrist.

What also bothers me is that if my fear is true, then that would mean that I won't be able to trust even trust my psychologist nor a psychiatrist.

The nature of this fear makes it it not necessary for it to be true for me to question and detach myself from the world. The world seems shallow and not as lively as before, which makes it not so fun to engage in it and makes me question what the point of living is. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Last week I got my driver's license and I'm beyond stoked about it, especially because I've suffered from driving anxiety since day 1 of driving a car (now not nearly as much as I used to, though). At times I really didn't think I'd get my license despite being an alright driver. Something about having my (very nice, might I add) instructor eyeing my every move made me nervous leading up to almost every single driving session. I used to browse this subreddit in hope of finding other sufferers of DA, so to anybody doing what I used to do, I wanna say this: You *can* do it and one day *you'll* be the one looking back at that time where you used to be nervous about driving. I don't want to sound like I've got it all figured out or that I know how *you* should treat your anxieties, because obviously I don't, but I do have some tips that I hope can be helpful to someone (also, im not trying to promote any ""quick fixes"" here, I'm just trying to offer some insight into what worked for me personally, and also opening the floor to anybody who feels like sharing their story). Here's what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

* Exercise! Do anything that you enjoy that gets your heart rate up. Exercising releases endorphins and might also calm your nerves a bit. For me, going for a 5K in the morning helped take some of the edge off of my nerves before driving.
* Meditation / yoga. What's great about both of these methods of calming down is that they both focus heavily on being aware of your breathing. When we're feeling panicky, and often without noticing it, our bodies tense up and we start breathing shallow breaths. Just getting familiar with meditation and yoga practices made me so much more aware of my breathing, and I tried focusing on deepening my breath as I was driving.
* During my hours of researching online, I stumbled upon a video made by a girl who used to also suffer from driving anxiety ([Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUMcX5wngl8)). The points that she made that really had an impact on me were that (1) each time you get in the car, you get one step closer to achieving your goal. So even if you felt anxious or felt as thought the session went terribly, you're still one step closer. And (2) things are only gonna get more familiar to you the more you drive. Things are never going to get less familiar. I definitely had some driving sessions that I felt went terribly, and I went home in a bad mood obsessing about it. But accepting my mistakes and knowing that the next time I had a smaller chance of making them honestly helped me a lot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=""/r/Anxiety""&gt;/r/Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&amp;#39;t want to sound like I&amp;#39;ve got it all figured out or that I know how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should treat your anxieties, because obviously I don&amp;#39;t, but I do have some tips that I hope can be helpful to someone (also, im not trying to promote any &amp;quot;quick fixes&amp;quot; here, I&amp;#39;m just trying to offer some insight into what worked for me personally, and also opening the floor to anybody who feels like sharing their story). Here&amp;#39;s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise! Do anything that you enjoy that gets your heart rate up. Exercising releases endorphins and might also calm your nerves a bit. For me, going for a 5K in the morning helped take some of the edge off of my nerves before driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation / yoga. What&amp;#39;s great about both of these methods of calming down is that they both focus heavily on being aware of your breathing. When we&amp;#39;re feeling panicky, and often without noticing it, our bodies tense up and we start breathing shallow breaths. Just getting familiar with meditation and yoga practices made me so much more aware of my breathing, and I tried focusing on deepening my breath as I was driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During my hours of researching online, I stumbled upon a video made by a girl who used to also suffer from driving anxiety (&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUMcX5wngl8""&gt;Link to video&lt;/a&gt;). The points that she made that really had an impact on me were that (1) each time you get in the car, you get one step closer to achieving your goal. So even if you felt anxious or felt as thought the session went terribly, you&amp;#39;re still one step closer. And (2) things are only gonna get more familiar to you the more you drive. Things are never going to get less familiar. I definitely had some driving sessions that I felt went terribly, and I went home in a bad mood obsessing about it. But accepting my mistakes and knowing that the next time I had a smaller chance of making them honestly helped me a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So let's start with the big problem- I have a huge, huge fear of death. On some level I always have, but this anxiety over death has skyrocketed for me over the past few months. Specifically, fear of death for either myself, or my fiancee. Mostly fear for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the why. I've always been an anxious person, anxious over whatever big thing is happening in my life. Sometimes it's at a managable level, sometimes not so much. Right now it's definitely not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to circumstances beyond our control, my fiancee and I have been long distance for the last 8 months. We've been coping very well with it, frequently exchanging memes, talking about the future, skyping when we can... and in the next couple of months we can finally be together again, and don't have to worry about being separated like this again. We can actually start building our future together properly, and the idea of that fills me with so, so much happiness. On top of that, I get to live in a place that makes me happy and where I've made lots of friends. This is literally my fairytale coming true.

&amp;#x200B;

On the flipside of that... I'm pulled down by this immense, crippling fear that, somehow, something will come and take it all away before it even happens. My mind instantly jumps to death, since its the only thing that would bring it all crumbling down at this point. As far as I know, my fiancee and I are in good health, but even still, I am plagued with constant thoughts such as ""what if they get killed on their way to work"", ""what if they suddenly get diagnosed with something terminal"", ""what if their plane crashes on their way to seeing family"" etc etc etc.... it goes on and on, and despite my efforts of trying to convince myself that the chances of those things happening are small, my brain seems locked in this 'if it can happen, it will happen' state.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee is the love of my life. I know it might sound silly and/or naive, but I very truly believe that. Before them, I had dated others. My first relationship was just terrible and I didn't truly love that person despite trying to convince myself I did (they didn't love me either), my second relationship was with someone who had problems of their own and used me as their emotional punching bag. I was always in the wrong, I never cared about them, etc. It lead to them threatening to kill themselves and self harm in front of me, and stepping away was hard (I felt guilty) but it was the very best thing for both of us. We stayed in contact for a short time after and checked in with each other now and then, until they cut me off to please who they were currently dating. I felt oddly relieved for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a little later since I took a well needed break after that relationship. I was still vulnerable and got far too involved with someone who I met online and eventually met in person. They showed immense interest in me but had very deep problems of their own that they hadn't taken time to fix, and ultimately it led to them bailing on the possibility of a relationship between us. It was done with a lengthy email that I happened to read the night before I was due to show up at a very important meeting (which would have a big impact on my future). I was devastated, and whenever I got a reminder of them I felt a lead weight in my heart. It doesn't hurt me anymore now, but it lead to me making some bad dating decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Very soon after this, I moved to the place where I met my fiancee, but before I met them, I dated a few people casually, which I very quickly realised was not for me and I was very reckless at this time (I'll let you figure out what that means). I was very lonely and just wanted closeness, and for someone to care about me in that way. I know that's not the be all and end all of life, but at the time I felt desperate for it as I'd just moved to a place where I didn't know anyone, and it seemed like everyone I met and became friends with was in a loving relationship. I wanted that too and it lead me to choose some rather unsavoury people to date, who ended up driving my anxiety through the roof by cancelling plans, ignoring texts, etc. until the end came.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I met my fiancee. At the time I met them, I was over the idea of dating, but once we started talking and getting to know each other, I felt something I hadn't felt for the others- affection, not lust. This person was so, so different from the others I had dated. For once, I felt like I was on equal ground, that my interests and needs were just as important as theirs, that they genuinely cared for me, and weren't afraid to talk about feelings or be honest... and instead of elation, I felt comfort. I felt warmth. I felt real, genuine care. With the others I deluded myself into thinking they werent all bad, that everyone has flaws, that they must care about me because of X and Y, that it was just early days so of course they don't seem that invested yet etc... but the thing is, its true- when you're in a truly caring and loving relationship, you KNOW. It's obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

After a little bit we started dating, and I've never felt happier. I still feel individual and independent with them, and when we're together we're a great team. I've never felt on edge, like they're going to hurt me or like something is wrong. We've alrready been through some ups and downs together that hasn't been easy, but we've stayed strong through it and they've always offered honest yet caring advice and support for me. We've got different interests too, and respect them. I don't want to use the word 'perfect', but we just seem to click. Any conflict we've had has never been major and we've both been willing and able to talk them out.

&amp;#x200B;

If I ever, EVER lost them... I honestly don't know what I'd do. They've become such a big part of my life now, and pretty much everything I have to look forward to in the future is connected to them. Our big plans. Our adventures. I'm so , so excited, but I am so, so scared that something will take them away from me, and everything will be lost. Including myself. Right now I'm trying to function as normal (I kind of need to because I have a lot to sort out before we get married) and trying various things to remain calm and positive, like candlelight meditation, listening to anxiety podcasts, concentrating on my physical training... but my sleep is suffering and I feel on the verge of panic quite often.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here ever gone through anything like this? Do you have any advice on what to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

If you managed to read to the end, thankyou... I know its a lot to get through but I had to spill it, it was welling up inside.

So, fast forward - I now have serious anxiety about spending money, saving money, and the result on my wallet after eating out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my small income, I am happy with the budgeting app I just recently found. But I KNOW that if I'm have excess money it's going to go towards food. I'm deleting my food apps (is there a way to ban them?!!), unsubscribing from all food related content online, refusing to go out when hungry, locking debit and credit cards, even choosing not to spend time with certain friends who I know will want to eat out to avoid the triggers. What else can I do to SAVE ME FROM MY WALLET. I know myself, and this isn't enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, how do I avoid the SURVIVAL MODE of having/using no excess funds on food/fun? It always backfires and I try to ""treat myself"" by going out for food.

This would be an app you could download and use with the Google cardboard. I've suffered anxiety myself and have a pretty clear idea of what it will be.  
It would be a very casual storyline with breathing methods, just something to clear your head and help you focus on something else, a bit like the escape rooms games but without the stress or the pressure.  


I would love to hear your feedback, what you would like in a service like this? This is not to include in the paper, I'm just curious about what you think of the idea, if you've also thought about a VR device to help with anxiety and panic. I almost regret no being able to develop it.

&amp;#x200B;

Rules:

1. I am not allowed outside by myself ever
2. I cannot stay out past 7:30 if I am allowed to see a friend
3. No one is allowed over at my house
4. No sleepovers no matter what
5. I cannot have my own room (I share a small room with my sister. Also we have like two other spare rooms in the house that NO one uses)
6. I  can't wear a lot of things that other girls do, like shorts or tank tops in the summer

Another thing is that he gets really angry at little things I say, he calls me selfish and rude whenever I talk to him about these things. He has never been there for me when it comes to my emotions either. Whenever I go to him crying or I am upset he tells me that I am just acting, and that I am doing that to ruin his day.

&amp;#x200B;

He also ruined my childhood as well. When I was 9 he locked up all my stuff (like toys and books) inside of a closet and nailed the door shut. I wasn't allowed to leave the room and I had to study everyday even in the summer. I do not know why I had to do that. I have always gotten good marks in class, I am in grade 11 right now and I am an honors student. so I don't think this has anything to do with my grades being bad.  He would also scold me in public really loud and embarrass me. When I was 12 I started learning french in school, so he took all my movies away from me and forced me to watch everything in french. This doesn't sound so bad, but it got to the point where he would yell at me if I brought home anything, like books, that was in English. He did similar things like that by forcing me to take piano and guitar lessons that I didn't want to take, and then yell at me for not doing good enough, or telling him that I didn't want to do the lessons anymore. I feel so anxious around him and this lifestyle has made me so scared to do so many seemingly normal things. I don't know what to do anymore TBH.

About 2 weeks ago I was suffering quite bad chest pains and a general numbness around my chest and left arm.

She said that I was suffering from anxiety (even though I didn't feel anxious in myself..) and that painkillers will help the pain, which in turn will stop me worrying about the pain and the muscle spasms around my heart will stop .... so far so good. That was fine. And from Saturday (a week after the pain started) it had eased loads and pretty much gone. 

However, now I have constant nausea.... I'm on the 4th day and it doesn't let up - it's there all day. I can still eat, feel hungry, etc. but have a constant sick feeling that is in my stomach that sometimes just sits in my throat. I'm still working and getting on with life but it is always there...

When I finally got home, there was a thunderstorm ending and I waited in my car for a few minutes because a car was backed in to a parking spot with their headlights on (pretty unusual in my apartment complex).  I waited about six or seven minutes before finally deciding to go in.  Since the rain was lighter, I kept my umbrella closed and latched.  As soon as I got out of my car, I heard someone else get out of their car and come up quickly behind me.  It's ridiculously humid here in NC anyway, and the storms just made it worse, so my glasses were fogged up as soon as I got out of my car.  I kept walking quickly, despite the lack of rain, and heard the man coming up behind me even more quickly.  I could hear his footsteps loudly and breath clearly.

I got ready to swing my umbrella at him.  It's pretty weird that someone could walk that small of a distance, even if it was quickly, and be out of breath.  It was also weird that someone was following me that closely.  Seriously, if I had turned around and taken a step towards him, we've basically be kissing.

If it had been pouring still, I'd understand, but then I also probably would not have noticed.  But it was barely sprinkling after I waited in my car (which is why I waited).

I considered that maybe he was waiting for the rain to stop, but that doesn't explain why he got out of his car on the opposite side of the parking lot and caught up to me almost immediately.  It was sprinkling, as I said...  There was no reason to run, and definitely no reason to leave so little space in between me and him.  He also hesitated to open his door after I stopped and started looking at my phone (not doing anything, I was just trying to see what he was doing) and stepped back and looked at me twice before going in.

Okay so for a few months around six years ago, I had a series of intense feelings/thoughts that made me feel a type of certainty or doom that I would be eternally tortured. Since at the time I was also big on philosophy (playing with ideas like solipsism, determinism, idealism etc) I was scared that the fact that those feelings happened meant that I'd be eternally tortured and came up with various excuses as to why I shouldn't worry (ie the feeling didn't really happen and was just a false memory, even in the unlikely case I would be tortured for eternity I'd eventually get used to it, etc). Since then, the same worry cropped up a few times again (basically, fear of dooming myself to the worst possible thing, whatever it is).

Now, it's mostly died down since then, but around four years ago I learned about large numbers (like Graham's Number and TREE(3) etc, look them up, they're pretty mind-blowingly large!). Being me, I immediately came up with the idea of ""eternal torture, but with the pain multiplied by Graham's number, or another bigger number"". This caused a renewed fear of those feelings/thoughts coming back and dooming me to an even worse hell, mainly because I thought those numbers were so terrifyingly big. Of course, I've had similar thoughts/feelings of doom since then, but now I can usually immediately identify them as OCD thoughts/derealization/whatever, and dismiss them as silly and irrelevant. Still, for around 2 years since then, I was scared of the idea of these feelings/thoughts just recurring in my head forever and just one such feeling could be enough to doom me to eternity of unimaginable torture, or that I was doomed already due to my thoughts in the past; even though I rationally knew there was nothing to fear, I was also scared that I've possibly already doomed myself to worry about these things for the rest of my life. Even though I was never suicidal or anywhere close to it, I did often feel like I would potentially need to erase my memories (to ensure that these thoughts won't pop up again) or even somehow rewind my life (via time travel/meditation/drugs/whatever) just to ""relive"" key moments from the past few years and make sure I wasn't doomed, and stop worrying about it for good.

Now around 2 years and some months ago, these thoughts pretty much climaxed in a series of panic attacks to the point where I couldn't function at all (ie, instead of going to class, I'd spend hours performing OCD rituals), and I've been on Zoloft since then, which improved my life immensely. However, I still get those feelings of worry occasionally (what if I've already doomed myself, or will doom myself in the future? what if I continue to relapse into my anxiety over and over for the rest of my life? is there any hope for me to let go of this completely? etc.) I guess my question is, is there any hope that this will go away entirely (without extreme scenarios like erasing parts of my memory, reliving my life through a psychedelic trip, committing to a mental hospital, etc)? Or should I keep worrying that I'm doomed for eternity? Has anyone else struggled with this type of anxiety or similar to it before, especially where really morbid ideas like eternal torment are concerned?

edit: Somewhat related, but I've read up on Calvinism, which is a little similar in that it involves people being predestined toward eternal torment. Makes me glad I'm not a Calvinist at least (though hopefully that won't become my new OCD obsession :/)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so for a few months around six years ago, I had a series of intense feelings/thoughts that made me feel a type of certainty or doom that I would be eternally tortured.

First and foremost, Pardon me if this is the wrong forum to post. I have no idea where to post and I am looking for direction or advice from people who have been in my shoes. 

I am your average person in their 20's with a job. I used to use marijuana and coke and about three years ago I suffered a mild heart attack from coke. I also used to use cigarettes, but since then my only vice is alcohol, mainly beer which I drink socially on the weekends and sometimes during the week.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, if I drink and then walk too much, my chest feels weird. However today, after a bad day at work where I felt stressed due to under performance, I decided to have one beer and go home. As I was walking my heart started to beat very hard and I felt like I was on the verge of experiencing a heart attack or a panic attack where I felt a tremendous amount of anxiety and helplessness. 

I am not the most healthy person on earth but I have made an effort to eat fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, quit smoking, quit using drugs and be the best person I can be. 

I will hopefully be getting a check up soon but I am afraid that I am vulnerable to another heart attack... I am also confused because I only had one drink while I've had way more on other days and be totally fine. As of right now my heart is beating at around 75 bpm- 5 hours after my episode when I thought I was going to die. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up slowly walking away after sitting down for 10 mins in pain, bought a bottle of water, chugged it, stabilized my heart beat, took the train and since then laid down, took it easy and now feel much better, but afraid and scared for what the future holds for me if I drink alcohol or exert myself, or stress myself from work or the rigors of living in a city and in life again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't mock me, and I welcome all advice and commentary insofar as its constructive. I just can't bear the thought that I have wrecked my health and I won't be able to work, or enjoy my life moving forward despite being in my 20's.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt seem to calm down, I have a doctors appointment in a few hours but just cannot calm down like I‚Äôm literally at the point of calling the ambulance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always feel like I‚Äôm gonna die when I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôm so scared :( &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else suffer health anxiety?&lt;/p&gt;

Tl:Dr - slowing down makes it all worse

It's been nearly a year since I walked away from running a business. The area started getting bad with drugs and violence, I ended up being the only business left open 24/7 in the area. Police didn't take much interest and responded slowly, and I had to lock down multiple times a month from gang violence. I could be pinned in a corner and talk down a doped out banger until they left. I thank God I never got hurt, but through all that I never had to reach for my meds, and I could walk back inside, have a cup of coffee and keep working.

Now, I'm running a warehouse/retail hub and can't walk the floor without having panic and heavy anxiety. Sitting down in my office is out of the question some days. It's like I can't slow down. There's no threat of violence, no danger beyond maybe slipping on trash. 

My days off I wake up with severe depersonalized feelings, takes hours to break it and I feel drained to where I just hit autopilot. I'm now taking my meds multiple times a day, everyday.

Anyone else ever have this? It seems so ass backwards to be somewhere less stressful, easier, with consistent hours and to have anxiety blow off the charts. It's draining me and my family more than where I was before. How does one slow down fully?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible trigger warnings: violence, gangs&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry this is so long but please hear me out. So I currently work at a couple libraries and don't have many hours at one of them but now, I'm wanting even less hours because of something recent. For I think about a little over a month now, this guy that used to work there (and I used to work with) has been acting strange. He's always been strange and I've always had the feeling that he might have Aspergers or something. A little over a year ago, he left to work at another library. Recently, he started calling our library and every time, he asked to ""pass along positive messages"" to the supervisor. When it started to become frequent, my supervisor called the library he works at now and asked if everything's ok and said we were starting to get a little concerned. I don't know what they said and didn't want to pry.

Ok so that was that. But a couple weeks ago, when I was working, he came. He came to the front desk. I was on the computer and he said ""Hello, Miss (my last name), I turned around. I nervously said hi. He asked me if I worked during the week. I stupidly said yes, which I regret now. Then he said ""Can you pass along a positive message to (my supervisor's name)?"" After a second, I said ""Sure. What is it?"" He said ""Oh. It's ok. I can do it myself,"" and walked away. Then he was just lurking around and sitting and doing nothing. I was thinking it was very weird, the way he approached me. Some time passed and he came back to the desk and approached my co-worker. He said to her, ""I have a question."" She asked, ""what's the question?"" A few seconds went by, he smiled big and yelled ""Next time!"" and he turned around and walked away. Something about all of it was very bizarre and kinda creepy and we knew to let the supervisor know the next day.

The next day, I told my supervisor about it. She was like ""Yeah. He has been acting pretty strange but there's really nothing we can do about it right now."" So that was that. But later that day, I found out that he had been coming to our library every day for that last week. And every time, he was doing the same weird things like approaching people at the desk like that and just lurking around. I learned that all my co-workers were feeling kinda threatened. I had a conversation with one of my co-workers that particularly freaked me out. I asked her ""Do you think this situation could be potentially dangerous?"" She said yes with confidence. I said to her ""apparently, there's not much we can do right now"" and she said ""yeah, well, unfortunately, it's gonna take him coming here with a gun for something to be done about it. For someone to get killed.""

After I left there for the day, I texted my friend who also works there that I was officially frightened. She agreed and said that there should be something done about it. Later that night, she texted me that he came back again. This time, the library director had a talk with him. The next day, we all got an email saying that he's welcome to come to the library as long as he acts like a patron and he hasn't been. But every time he comes, make sure to make note of what goes on and that we are welcome to leave the desk if we feel uncomfortable.

So in the last couple weeks, I've heard that he was there one time and he was on the computer. First thing I thought was that we should see what he was looking up. And even if it seemed harmless, I still wouldn't be convinced. For the last few days, I've been so shaken up for some reason. He never seemed like someone who'd get violent but every time I've worked there for the last couple weeks, I've turned around to see who's coming into the library. Every room I go in, I've located a possible exit in case I start to hear gunshots from another room. I'm just very very cautious. And my supervisor has just given me a few more hours for the summer, starting tomorrow. And I'm sorry if I'm being overly dramatic, but I am feeling afraid to go to work. I feel my heart beating faster and my chest even hurting a little. Even a little out of breath. I just hope it's just some crazy hunch and nothing will happen. I don't really know what to do.

I haven't been on holiday since I moved out and stopped tagging along with my parents, but this year I've got some leave built up and some room in my budget so I figured it might be time to try that.

Problem is travelling is a really daunting prospect (I'm sure I'm not alone there).

Problem is I don't want to end up with a bunch of middle aged people or something (not that they're awful but I'm in my 20s) but don't want to end up on some lads on tour drugstravaganza as I've heard some ""young people"" tours can be.

And that's if I don't just straight up make some dumb mistake and get left behind in Bangkok or trapped in a Turkish prison on a misunderstanding on my part.

I really love the idea of taking a holiday but I can't get it out of my mind that it's an enormous minefield where any one mistake is going to leave me stranded, thousands of miles from a familiar face, surrounded by people who I can't even communicate with properly, no idea how to even get food or travel between a hotel and an airport safely and reliably.

Tl;dr Went to GP, was prescribed beta-blocker for anxiety symptoms, now too anxious to take them. Also too anxious to stop taking them. 
Looking for advice on overcoming fear of taking medication and any experiences. 



So I finally made the big jump and talked to my GP about anxiety. She was lovely and very understanding, gave me some very good self help tips and gave me contact details for a local service that provides CBT, she also asked if I would be open to trying medication and I usually wouldn't be but I've been at rock bottom and I've been desperate (which I told her) so I'd try anything.  

She prescribed me beta-blockers and told me its commonly prescribed to students during exams as well. 
She also explained that they wouldn't directly act on my brain but rather prevent the physical symptoms and so in a way stop the feedback loop. 

So I've picked up my prescription and I took my first tablet late last night after waiting for my mum to come home as I mainly have severe health anxiety and was worried about side effects or an allergy to the ingredients and so only felt safe taking them knowing that she could jump in to help if something went wrong. 
I took my tablets and they helped relive a week long migraine and it felt so nice not to have a nasty pressure sensation in my head for a change. 


I'm now in a position again where I'm very scared to take my next one, and am waiting for my mum to arrive from work just in case something bad happens again. 
This isn't possible in the long run as I'm going back to my flat (3hr train ride away) on Thursday. 

I know they are are also taken as preventatives for heart attacks and an worried they will impact the way my heart works (which I guess is how they help me in the first place, I know they slow down heart rate but what if it gets too slow?) and have been advised not stop taking them suddenly so am not sure of its a medication I'd like to be tied to. 
I also read on the safety leaflet that they can cause seizures that are associated with low blood sugar levels which is slightly concerning as my diet is very bad as I sometimes go a few days without food and then eat enough for a whole family the next few days, I am a healthy weight as these behaviours cancel each other out calorie wise but it would mean my blood sugar is not consistent.

That can be really tough."" Like, within ten minutes she picked right up on a significant issue of mine.

So she ended up sending me out of our first visit with some new anti-anxiety meds to try out and we made another appointment for two months later.

Yesterday was that second appointment. Things went as expected. We talked about the new meds and she ended up raising the dosage. No big deal but she made sure to explain that a higher dosage than I was taking is very common. At one point she asked if I had set up any appointments with a therapist at the clinic. I hadn't. When she asked if there was any particular reason for that I said something like, ""no, not really. I just have to get off my ass and do it."" She seemed to understand and we left it at that. I went home and didn't think much of it.

Today I got a call from a therapist at the clinic about making an appointment. My doctor must have taken it upon herself to talk to someone about reaching out to me. 

I'm well aware that as an adult it's my responsibility to make my own phone calls and appointments. I accept that, but sometimes it takes awhile for me to actually do something, even if the actual act of doing it isn't that big a deal.

I (30F) just need to chat to someone for help, advice or anything really.

Four months ago now I had the worst anxiety of my life, at it's worst I thought I would have to give up everything (job, independence etc) and move back home. I put it down to changing jobs, a bad relationship and losing some friends.

I ended the relationship and was open with my manager about the anxiety. I slowly got functional and human again, albeit still depressed. It's been truly awful at times

Fast forward to now, I knew I was still in a rut and unhappy at work so I decided to apply for a new job, to make a positive step. By some miracle, I got through the interview.

But now the flippin anxiety is back exactly as it was! Arghhh! I want to take the job because it seems to be a better opportunity and to have lots of positive benefits, but my body is panicking. Just the thought of facing not knowing what I'm doing and having to fight that all over again just seems unbearable.

I know it won't go away until I feel comfortable at the new place, which could be months. 

It's ridiculous, I've moved jobs and cities before and never had this kind of fear.

I'm in therapy and planning to start medication, but I have to let people know if I'm going to take the job in the next two days.

I've found out as much as I can from people who work there, they say it's a supportive and friendly workplace, but my anxiety won't listen.

Any advice, anything really is appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, I knew I was still in a rut and unhappy at work so I decided to apply for a new job, to make a positive step. By some miracle, I got through the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now the flippin anxiety is back exactly as it was! Arghhh! I want to take the job because it seems to be a better opportunity and to have lots of positive benefits, but my body is panicking. Just the thought of facing not knowing what I&amp;#39;m doing and having to fight that all over again just seems unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it won&amp;#39;t go away until I feel comfortable at the new place, which could be months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ridiculous, I&amp;#39;ve moved jobs and cities before and never had this kind of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in therapy and planning to start medication, but I have to let people know if I&amp;#39;m going to take the job in the next two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found out as much as I can from people who work there, they say it&amp;#39;s a supportive and friendly workplace, but my anxiety won&amp;#39;t listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, anything really is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Been offered a job, too anxious to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

The only thing about my job that I‚Äôve noticed is that nobody is confrontational.

How many things have I continued to do wrong unknowingly without being corrected?

I‚Äôve got some pretty nasty anxiety &amp; depression and it‚Äôs starting to really affect my personal life with others. My BF (bless his heart) is very patient and supportive and sweet but I know that he is exhausted from helping me and comforting me when I‚Äôm down (which has been A LOT recently).

I‚Äôve decided that enough is enough. I can‚Äôt drive to see my old therapist, but I‚Äôm going to skype her instead (even though I gave intense video call anxiety) and I‚Äôm going to find a doctor where I can get medicated. I‚Äôve also decided to work on some personal methods/strategies to help diffuse my intrusive thoughts and feelings. I know that this is an illness- it‚Äôs not something I can decide to get rid of- but I can definitely do better to fight the thoughts that get me into really bad situations/mindsets.

I had the idea to get some smiley/sad/neutral face stickers (like a child, I know) and mark each day with a sticker depending on how good I felt. Obviously if something happened that was completely out of my control (someone getting hurt, getting scolded at work, other emergencies) then I can‚Äôt blame myself for the issue- I‚Äôm talking more, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt let myself stay in the anxious/panicked mindset and I got myself out and I felt better which means it was a good day‚Äù. It‚Äôs kind of silly but I think it might work. 

There won‚Äôt be a punishment for bad days but I can‚Äôt think of a good reward for good days. I don‚Äôt have a lot of money so I can‚Äôt go all out and go shopping or anything.

Anyways, I am feeling all kinds of emotions this past few months. 

I get anxiety about everything,  I fear diseases and would constantly google symptoms of said diseases and would panic whenever they match with what I was experiencing.  Melanoma,  brain cancer;  you name it lol.  Now, I am experiencing crazy anxiety about my computers and phones having hackers spying on them.  I would panic at the thought of my private pictures and information getting leaked out to everyone everywhere.

I am not asking to be happy,  I just want to be normal; able to feel sadness and happiness from time to time.

I struggle to get out of bed, I have no motivation whatsoever. When things get really bad,  I would even stop taking a bath (nasty.) and even eating. I would only eat at most a meal a day when things are bad.

Has anyone else experienced this? Or at least have any tips on how to deal with this type of anxiety?&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôve been riding horses since I was 4. Stopped when I was 16, and have been riding again for almost 2 years. So it was about a 4 year break. 

I take lessons at a hunter barn and also have a rescue horse I work with with a trainer. 

At my lessons, I‚Äôm not so scared and anxious. I recently just competed in my first show and even got first place in 2 out of 6 classes! But for some reason, my rescue horse joe, makes me so scared and anxious. Every time I ride home I have a panic attack(I think?) my legs/hands starts shaking, I breath really hard, I cry, I‚Äôm so scared it‚Äôs almost like I can‚Äôt see, but I can see so maybe I‚Äôm just unable to focus on anything? I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt be the same rider on him that I am on my lesson horse. 

I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll buck, rear, bolt, etc etc. on the ground I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll spook and knock into me, or bite me, or buck at me and kick me. 

On the ground my confidence with him has increased so much. But as soon as I get in the saddle I fall apart. 

My trainer explained that the lesson horse is like a college student and I‚Äôm the teacher. When I make a mistake, the horse knows enough that it can realize it and compensate for me. But joe is like a 5th grader and I‚Äôm the teacher. He still needs to be told to stand in line, to bring his pencil to class etc etc. so I‚Äôm so nervous and joe doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with it and so he starts misbehaving (mainly headtossing, walking quickly to the gate and refusing to leave while tossing his head), and it makes me so scared and I just freeze up and have a panic attack. 

I think this has happened so many times that even when he does do good I still am so nervous I can‚Äôt stand it. Just thinking about riding him makes me so scared and I just dread it. 

My trainer says I am capable of riding him through the behavior but my anxiety does not allow me too. I want things to start going better with joe but I just don‚Äôt know if my mind can take many more rides on him. I tell myself I can do it and try to think positively but as soon as I get to the mounting block it all goes out the window. 

My trainer is very encouraging and she always tells me how proud she is of me for still working with him with how nervous it makes me. And we do have a plan to try to make things work but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish I could be confident and not just think the worst of what could happen. 

I guess this is more of just a vent and I hope that‚Äôs allowed. But any encouragement or advice is definitely appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take an antidepressant every morning and have been going to therapy since November 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

I really wanted to get around 90 percent but I think I just got above 80 percent because I wanted an A\* to average out with my other exams. Now I kind of feel just pissed off and sad a bit because my efforts seem like there were put to waste.

I still have one final exam in 2 days and I have already prepared for that too, just been going over my mistakes but I just feel really angry. I've already got my place at university but I'm a bit worried about my graduate roles.

I want to become an accountant and know there are ways of becoming one but I feel like i need to do really well to feel like I've deserved it.

I don't feel suicidal or anything compared to last year. But I just feel really angry for panicking and messing up the questions I could easily do.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if anyone in here has ever tried bullet journals as a way of really controlling anxiety, but over the course of this year it has been one of the single accountable tools to completely remove anxiety from my life! I for sure think if you haven't you should give one a go.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd absolutely love it if you could check out my latest video i put out last night, i talk about how the bullet journal gave me all the mental clarity and positivity i have nowadays!

I hope it helps at least one human :)

Stu x","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if anyone in here has ever tried bullet journals as a way of really controlling anxiety, but over the course of this year it has been one of the single accountable tools to completely remove anxiety from my life! I for sure think if you haven&amp;#39;t you should give one a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d absolutely love it if you could check out my latest video i put out last night, i talk about how the bullet journal gave me all the mental clarity and positivity i have nowadays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope it helps at least one human :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

But today when the call came that she was ready instead of crying I asked my friend for help. He rode it to work for me and at the end of my shift I sat down and practiced my deep breathing. Went over the ( ten-fifteen minute) route in my head and got on trying not to cry or let my anxiety pull me back in. I started her up, and just went.

I freaked out the whole way. The ENTIRE time I was waiting to screw up. I still can't believe that I not only made it home, but I didn't stall! I went the speed limit! I did it!

Anyways, sometimes my bf of 3 years brings up more ""wild"" type sexual things. It's not even wild idk how to describe it. But examples are: strip clubs, sex clubs/swinger clubs, raver type festivals where people walk around naked and stuff. He hasn't been to a strip club in years and has never done anything besides sex w/ a parter. Now, i've been to strip clubs before in years past and am pretty sexually adventurous within my relationships, but whenever he brings these things up (he's not suggesting them) it makes me so anxious. Some examples are:

1) he'll say ""my friend's wanted to go to a strip club but I told them no""

&amp;#x200B;

2) ""my friend went to this raver sex festival and he said he had a great time because he saw so many tits and stuff"" 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I originally liked about him was how uptight he was, especially morally or whatever I guess. It felt safe and secure and reliable. I don't think he'd ever go to a sex festival thing, and certainly not if I asked him not to or without me, but even him bringing it up gives me anxious thoughts. I guess like w/ example #2, I think like ""does it sound like fun to YOU to walk around high on ecstasy with 100's of naked women around?"" and part of me feels like yes, of course it does. But then I wonder ""well certainly not every guy would like that."" and then I feel anxious when I tell him it makes me uncomfortable or something, like I'm not enough of a ""cool girl"". AND THEN I remember that I'm not a ""cool girl"" and i don't want to be either.

Ill be writing down everything that comes into my head. Everything that ive bottled up these couple of 6/7 months. 

I‚Äôve suffered with anxiety basically my entire life. I‚Äôll be 22 this year. I grew up watching my moms ex husband beat her to death growing up and I was physically abused by him and my mother. I hold no grudges towards her and love her till this day. She had to do what she had to do in order for us to survive. 
Fast forward, I was an okay child. Obviously a wild one like most teens growing up, but nothing like getting into trouble with the cops or anything, just mostly parting and going at it with my mom half the time- typical teenage girl shit lol 

Anyways, because of my upbringing I was always an excessive worrier. I thought that was normal all my life. I would worry about the smallest stuff every single day. I started getting panic attacks, but I was always able to control them. I was always in denial about having an anxiety disorder because it made me feel weak and I don‚Äôt like the idea of feeling weak because I have overcome so much in my life. 

I do have certain health problems, I suffer from hiatal hernia pain and PCOS (feel free to look it up if you‚Äôre reading this). 

It all started in December where my breaking point started. December of 2018, I started having stomach pain, I couldn‚Äôt swallow food or drink because it hurt so bad, so me being me I decided to look up my symptoms, rather than going to the doctors. It all went downhill from there. It basically said I was dying and that made me freak out. I started having panic attacks. I felt as if I was dying. My throat felt like it was closing in on me and my chest started feeling heavy. After that night, I refused to eat and drink water because I thought I was going to choke on my food or on water. I started concentrating on my breathing, every single day. I slowly started forgetting how to swallow.  I feared death. My boyfriend works nightshift,So my sister would have to stay awake with me all night because I needed someone with me 24/7 or I would start freaking out if left alone. 

I was ashamed that my 15 year old sister had to take care of her older sister. I no longer wanted to be in this world, I lost everyone- all my friends/ close family members. I isolated myself. I couldn‚Äôt leave my room because this was my safe zone. I was depressed to the point that I stopped eating, showering, or simply brushing my teeth. I felt weak. I finally made the choice to go see my PCP where he prescribed Prozac but my body rejected it. It made my anxiety worse and I was at the point where my body was giving up on me. I wouldn‚Äôt walk because I was so weak from not eating. 

I finally came to terms with my fear of dying. I told myself if I die today, Im dying. It helped for a month or so. Im still learning how to swallow but its still a slow process. I still panic when I eat or drink water but im doing better. 

Today is June 18th, currently 3:07. 
I still suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I feel weak and dead inside and no one understands what im going through. All I hear from people is that its a mind game. I know its a mind game, but thats not the help I need. I need help, I cant take it anymore. Im not someone who‚Äôll ever think of ending it, but im weak and need help from a friend who‚Äôll understand.

Brief history: bullying, severe sleep deprivation (1 year) and cardio exercise triggered panic attacks. My panic attacks would wake me up after being briefly asleep. Then it would cease, I would get exhausted and fall asleep, yet panic would wake me up again. This would be happening for 9 hours/entire night. Pure madness.

It got resolved with SSRIs, then i stopped taking them, then these symptoms returned. Then I was put on heavier meds, which i successfully quit last year and i have been keeping myself stable with Mg threonat), Zn, probiotics, NAC, coenzyme q10....

But to the point: Day before yesterday I had too much adrenaline from exercise in the evening, and i slept super poorly and yesterday I was falling asleep after autogenic training and three capsules of Mg threonate (so i was SUPER relaxed).

But never to this extent of literally electric shocks. Also, my father got a bit of anxiety issues last year (he is 56) and he also reports waking up and weird sensations in solar plexus.&lt;/p&gt;

I lack the social paranoia. I can be in a stage with 1,000 strangers looking at me, and im fine

I legit care very little about other people's perception and i dont get super nervous when a new situation comes up

I haven't had a friend for about 5-6 years (I'm currently 18 years old) because of this I get extremely lonely and depressed. I have made up some friends in my mind and I pretend they are real just so I have ""someone"" to talk to. It doesn't help that my 16 year old sister has dozens of friends over every single day. I hear them all laughing and having fun and it just makes me really sad. My sister always talks about the fun things she does with her friends and has all these crazy/funny stories. A few people have tried to reconnect with me or tried to be my friend, but my anxiety is so intense that I end up just pushing everyone away. My main issue is that I would love to have friends, but I'm too scared to have friends. All these years people don't understand what I mean when I say I forgot how to be a friend, I don't know what friends are supposed to do anymore, like how do people hang out? When I don't have someone trying to be my friend, I am depressed and lonely. But, when people try to hang out with me, I push them away and wish I was alone again. It is so insanely frustrating and confusing! I have wasted all my teenage years hidden away in my room while everyone else is out making money at their job, making friends, getting their licenses, doing fun things, starting relationships, going different places, etc.

I have tried making friends with people online, but eventually they end up wanting to call or video chat which makes me extremely anxious. I have an insane fear of talking to people on the phone. A guy I used to know from elementary school tried to reconnect with me recently. He started out texting, then calling, and now he just shows up at my house whenever. I am in constant fear every day I wake up because I know he could call me or just show up at my door.

I just don't know what to do. I am so insanely lonely, and people have tried to help me out but I think I'm too used to being lonely. I hate being alone, but I hate being around people. It makes no sense. I am currently slipping back into depression because now that its summer time, everyones out of school and stuff. I have done online school for all of high school, so I really mean it when I say I don't talk to anyone. I also don't have my license, don't have a job, am no where near being able to be in a relationship, and yes...still a virgin. Comparing my life to my sisters', I feel like a complete loser. I couldn't even go to my graduation ceremony because of all the people. When I explain all this to them, no one understands, which I get because I don't even understand it myself. People just get so tired of my excuses and complaining about being anxious that they just give up on me.

Thank you if you have read all of this. Is anyone in a similar situation? I would at least love to have a friend who understands and has the same issues I have, and maybe we could just only text, no normal people want to just text though, they always end up wanting to call, video chat, or meet up in person. I'm just so desperate for any human interaction at this point its driving me crazy... but I also get extremely anxious when I have any human interaction. Ugh, I just don't know... :(

It is what it is, she has had problems for years and I cannot change that.  

How I tend to deal with things is social media, I hate phone calls or face to face contact. Had a breakdown last year when I realized that I could no longer be with my wife because I simply could not deal with no feeling wanted anymore and the fact that she had medical and physchological issues. 

Dropped off the face of the Earth for a while and had no contact with anyone outside of my immediate circle that I feel comfortable with. Ignored calls and texts from all my family till I felt bad enough to contact them.

Anyway came to a head today when I posted about my mom on Facebook and other family members jumped all over me that how dare I do that when not everyone knows? My Brother and I went back and forth and said some awful things to each other over text.

To me I value my freindships, some of which were very close at one point in my life or another even if we live all around North America and never see each other anymore. Far more than I value my relationship with my family. 

I don't hate my family and we had a very good life and I had an amazing childhood but I just don't feel much towards them at all. In contrast I care everything about my Pregnant Girlfriend, her 4 year old son and her family. Maybe because I chose them?

To me I have already lost Mom, she is sleeping almost 24 hours a day and will soon slip into a Coma and pass peacefully. That doesn't bother me, I am ok with it and don't even feel anything about it right now.

What I dread is the thought of being around family members and them telling me how sorry they are and the awkwardness of the whole situation. I want no part in it and I honestly don't care if I see them again one way or another. Even my Dad and my oldest brother that I have always been close with. Now Dad is showing the early signs of Dementia and I don't want to deal with that either.

Is there something wrong with me? I know I am different but I just dread all that. Could care less about my Mom passing as I have already come to terms.

I've never lived in the same room as anyone before, so I'm worried for how it's gonna be like - I need a lot of time to myself, even if I was rooming with any of my best friends I don't feel like I could stand living like that, and especially rooming with a stranger I don't want to annoy them by staying in the dorm all day (I'll try to join some clubs or at least hang out in the library/common areas but you know how it is with anxiety, who knows how well those'll work out, and I love just holing up in my room with a good game or anime). Also, the rooms are tiny, like half the size of my current bedroom, and even with loft beds set up it feels like there's no chance for privacy. There's concerns about sleeping and stuff too, while I'm a deep sleeper and can fall asleep after being woken up, I have trouble initially falling asleep in the first place so especially if my roommate snores or shuffles a lot in bed while I'm trying to fall asleep I just can't get any sleep at all (though that's not anxiety related, might be autism related but not sure? just can't stand noise in the room besides like clock ticking before I fully fall asleep, might be concerns about noise from other dorms but that's more discrete and far enough away I'm not too worried)

I also can't start conversations/small talk with people I don't know very well (or don't instantly click with), basically anyone besides my family and pre-existing friends, unless it's a convo about something I'm really interested in - I don't want to judge by appearances, but the girl I've been matched up with doesn't seem like she'd share my interests (the matching survey didn't even bring up interests/hobbies) and while she shared her instagram and snapchat with me, I don't use those and don't feel comfortable sharing the social media I do use (reddit/twitter/tumblr) so honestly I don't even know how to start to get to know her. I'm already jumping to the worst case scenario of her making tons of friends, inviting people over, while I stay an awkward mess and she tells her friends how weird and antisocial I am. Even if she doesn't go that far, just her trying to start any conversations with me regularly besides generic hellos/goodbyes/goodnights/heading out/etc is gonna be hard to respond to. Not excited to work out a dorm room/roommate agreement either, even if that's the bare minimum of social interaction I'd need with her.

My anxiety feels like it's getting worse and more frequent too ever since around the end of the school year, just earlier today I had to visit the doctor by myself for the first time and barely held back an anxiety attack in the waiting room (was still half-crying and having trouble breathing for the first half of the physical but they didn't bring it up luckily besides just taking a moment to let me catch my breath for respiratory checks). I'm worried that if any of these hit during the school year (which is incredibly likely, with classes featuring group work or public speaking especially) I won't have a safe space to be able to cry it out if my roommate's in the dorm - even if there's a quiet empty place on campus (or in a bathroom stall), it's still too open and public for me and I'd feel even worse crying there. 

I'm not sure if I should seek professional help or not either, my dad contacted the school to ask about single rooms (and if mental health impacted availability for them) and they said all the single rooms were full, but I'd be put on top of the waiting list for one if I could get a medical professional to sign off on a form with an official diagnosis, as well as symptoms + what accommodations they would recommend for lessening symptoms. My mom's not super supportive of my mental health and likes to pretend I've 'grown out' of my autism diagnosis and doesn't think anxiety exists; while my dad is slightly more supportive he's also not entirely sold on getting any professional assistance, though he did say there's a possibility of setting up a psych eval sometime if I really wanted to because he knows how much I want a single room. On top of all this, getting professional help seems terrifying in general, even though I know it might help me out in the long run. Plus I read a bunch of other posts about getting accommodations for a single room because of anxiety, and supposedly a lot of psychologists don't recommend it, so even if I did get professional help I don't know if it'd help out the dorm/roommate dilemma. 

If anyone has any assistance with how to deal with college/roommates/dorms/anxiety in general/etc, I'd appreciate any help, I really don't know what to do in this situation and even just thinking about having to live with a roommate makes me feel terrible and cry. I also still need to respond to my roommate's greeting email and have been overthinking that for a few hours, not sure what to bring up or how to make this first impression. Wish I had the opportunity to just pay extra money for a single :/

It was really hell, but once the deadlines were over it just sort of died down.

Rant incoming...

Im a 25 year old otherwise healthy (afaik) male. I used to be really Into fitness and outdoor activities like hiking and rock climbing and frisbee etc. and doing all this stuff with a group of good friends. I've had issues with anxiety and depression most of my life but the last few months have been the roughest bout of anxiety (specifically health anxiety) yet. I know I should visit my doctor and get a full check up since I haven't seen him an a couple years, but I'm scared of finding out for sure something is actually wrong with me physically.

I constantly think there's something wrong with my body and that it's about to shut down at any time. I sit around and don't do much most of the time because I'm worried my body can't handle physical exertion. I've stopped working out. I've stopped playing outdoor games like soccer and frisbee. I've stopped doing anything that accelerates my heart rate significantly.

I feel like it's harder to breath sometimes or that I can't Inhale for a second and it makes me think that there's something wrong with my lungs or my breathing muscles and I'll just stop breathing and die. 

I've had a small ache feeling near my heart for weeks straight and occasionally a stabbing pain which lasts for a few seconds that I think is a hear attack when it happens. My heart pounds more often then not and I can almost always feel it beating in my chest. I sometimes feel what I can only describe as an uncomfortable bubble in my chest for a second or two.

I get headaches at least a few days a week which I assumed is either tension headaches or from mild dehydration but my mind makes me think it's from something dangerous.

I sometimes wake up shaking and usually think it's because I have some mineral/vitamin deficiency or am low on electrolytes and my muscles will stop working or that it's some other neurological disease. My hands feel shaky most of the time and I kinda feel like my body (typically my arms and head) have jerkier than normal motion, like it's not a smooth motion.

I have brain fog a lot and feel like I can't think straight or say words properly.

I've noticed that the ringing in my ears that I've had as long as I can remember seemed to suddenly get louder one day and stay that way. Sometimes I have a moment where the hearing in one ear drops out almost completely then slowly comes back over the course of 5-10 seconds accompanied by higher pitched ringing that also fades in 5-10 seconds. I'm worried I'll go deaf soon.

I've stopped talking to all of my friends because I don't want to explain what's going on, because I don't want them to see me diffidently, and had to move back in with my parents because I was having daily panic attacks. I can't keep a regular job at the moment and have almost no money. I have nobody to talk to and nothing to do that doesn't make me more anxious other then watch movies and YouTube. 

I feel like I have no real future at this point and this is how my life will be until I die. I wish I could try dating so I don't feel so lonely all the time but I know I could not handle a relationship right now and wouldn't have much to offer because all I think about is my body sensations.

I've been on Lexapro for about 3 months now and it seemed to help for a couple weeks. The daily panic attacks went away and I almost felt really good, but the anxiety came back after trying to add Wellbutrin (which I had to stop taking because it just made it worse) and I'm scared to try increasing the dosage of Lexapro now.

&lt;p&gt;Rant incoming...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im a 25 year old otherwise healthy (afaik) male. I used to be really Into fitness and outdoor activities like hiking and rock climbing and frisbee etc. and doing all this stuff with a group of good friends. I&amp;#39;ve had issues with anxiety and depression most of my life but the last few months have been the roughest bout of anxiety (specifically health anxiety) yet. I know I should visit my doctor and get a full check up since I haven&amp;#39;t seen him an a couple years, but I&amp;#39;m scared of finding out for sure something is actually wrong with me physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly think there&amp;#39;s something wrong with my body and that it&amp;#39;s about to shut down at any time. I sit around and don&amp;#39;t do much most of the time because I&amp;#39;m worried my body can&amp;#39;t handle physical exertion. I&amp;#39;ve stopped working out. I&amp;#39;ve stopped playing outdoor games like soccer and frisbee. I&amp;#39;ve stopped doing anything that accelerates my heart rate significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it&amp;#39;s harder to breath sometimes or that I can&amp;#39;t Inhale for a second and it makes me think that there&amp;#39;s something wrong with my lungs or my breathing muscles and I&amp;#39;ll just stop breathing and die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a small ache feeling near my heart for weeks straight and occasionally a stabbing pain which lasts for a few seconds that I think is a hear attack when it happens. My heart pounds more often then not and I can almost always feel it beating in my chest. I sometimes feel what I can only describe as an uncomfortable bubble in my chest for a second or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get headaches at least a few days a week which I assumed is either tension headaches or from mild dehydration but my mind makes me think it&amp;#39;s from something dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wake up shaking and usually think it&amp;#39;s because I have some mineral/vitamin deficiency or am low on electrolytes and my muscles will stop working or that it&amp;#39;s some other neurological disease. My hands feel shaky most of the time and I kinda feel like my body (typically my arms and head) have jerkier than normal motion, like it&amp;#39;s not a smooth motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have brain fog a lot and feel like I can&amp;#39;t think straight or say words properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that the ringing in my ears that I&amp;#39;ve had as long as I can remember seemed to suddenly get louder one day and stay that way. Sometimes I have a moment where the hearing in one ear drops out almost completely then slowly comes back over the course of 5-10 seconds accompanied by higher pitched ringing that also fades in 5-10 seconds. I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll go deaf soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve stopped talking to all of my friends because I don&amp;#39;t want to explain what&amp;#39;s going on, because I don&amp;#39;t want them to see me diffidently, and had to move back in with my parents because I was having daily panic attacks. I can&amp;#39;t keep a regular job at the moment and have almost no money. I have nobody to talk to and nothing to do that doesn&amp;#39;t make me more anxious other then watch movies and YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have no real future at this point and this is how my life will be until I die. I wish I could try dating so I don&amp;#39;t feel so lonely all the time but I know I could not handle a relationship right now and wouldn&amp;#39;t have much to offer because all I think about is my body sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on Lexapro for about 3 months now and it seemed to help for a couple weeks. The daily panic attacks went away and I almost felt really good, but the anxiety came back after trying to add Wellbutrin (which I had to stop taking because it just made it worse) and I&amp;#39;m scared to try increasing the dosage of Lexapro now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a failure and I just want to be able to do normal things that a young healthy guy my age should be doing before I actually do get old and these concerns become real. I do sometimes have moments of clarity when I feel happy and not anxious but it never lasts long before I feel a new thing that makes me think I&amp;#39;m dying...

But we keep coming back to eachother... It now turns out that we are both staying to study further next year so we will still be around eachother through and after summer.

She stayed over the other night and told me that she did really like me (never said it before although I've always been pretty upfront) but frustratingly she's sort of shut me out since.

I sort of want to try a relationship I think, but I don't know how to approach it with somebody who has this level of anxiety.

Basically I want to ask others with anxiety how can I approach this in a sensitive way and what is the best way to get her to talk openly? I don't want to outline all of her issues here, but she does seem to have severe anxiety, so is a proper relationship just never going to work until she's ready?

I've been very patient and tried to be sensitive with her to the point where friends have even pointed out that I'm being a bit of a 'doormat', letting everything happen on her terms and waiting around - is this an unhealthy dynamic or do I need to show her that I'm happy to wait because I genuinely like her? Am I coming to the difficult reality that a relationship with someone like this just isn't feasible right now in her life?

Doing so with my brother with me would make it 10 times more difficult because I feel a responsibility over him, and I wouldn't want to be asleep in case something were to happen. I have to make sure he always has his seat belt on. He might need me to help him put on his oxygen mask. I might need to show him the brace position as we plummet from the sky at extreme speeds. You know, stuff like that.

Plane crash statistics don't help me anyway. Every article I've read gives an inconsistent number, and even if they didn't, someone *still* has to crash in order to get that stat. Do you think those on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were also told how safe flying is and how nothing was going to happen to them? I don't trust modern pilots anyway.

I don't know how I'm going to manage. I've been on a dozen or so planes before, but the difference between those trips and the upcoming one is that I was either with my whole family or a tour group. I could rely on others to guide me throughout the airport and all I had to do was follow them. No one was dependent on me.

I am conducting a major research project as part of my Honours thesis in the Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours).

After the survey you can also enter the draw to win one of four $50 JB Hi Fi vouchers. Below is a link to the survey and the facebook research page.

It kinda feels like when you pull a muscle, and the area is tender. But the moment I feel my throat feeling lumpy or begin to feel it a little more I'm absolutely convinced I'm dying.  I'm getting dizzy now, and I'm crying, the pain is becoming more noticeable, and my hands are both pins and needly and I'm sure it's anxiety.

For as long as I can remember, I was always very shy and scared in social situations, but with puberty, it got really bad. Since I was 12 or probably even earlier, I just started not giving a fuck about anything. And I don't mean that in a good way. I got fat, rarely showered, spent my entire day in front of a PC, etc. I almost completely withdrew from social situations. I had exactly one friend, and that friend was less of a friend and more of someone who likes to boss people around.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I was absolutely not the type of guy I'd like to be. That all changed when I changed schools. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to change, to start being the person I'd like to be. During the next four years, I was really starting to see the light. I thought I'd pull through, I really thought I'd beat this shitty voice in my head that always says I'm worthless and the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because my mom would be devastated. And I did beat it, or I made it worse, depending on how you see it. There are now three types of people who each produce three different reactions in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, there are complete strangers. I can interact with them really well, without regrets afterwards, because I'm almost certain to never see them again.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there are people I know and like, or getting to know. In immediate social situations, I often feel watched. Like one of them is gonna burst out in laughter and say that they'd never be friends with me, and that I was stupid to think they would. Afterwards, I always know that this is just in my head. I just can't get it out. But when I'm at home, every single night I lie in bed and hate myself for this tiny thing I said that might have forever scared them into hating me. I can't sleep for at least half an hour, sometimes I've spent half the night contemplating how stupid and worthless I am.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there are people I really care about. There are only 2 people I feel that way about. In a lot of social situations with them, I feel relaxed. I know for a fact that they do care about me. But once I say something even slightly embarrassing or I fuck up and say something that I haven't thought about and might be considered slightly offensive, I become a total mess. I feel like they must hate me now (which they don't, by the way) and then I start hating myself. When it gets real bad, I excuse myself, go to the bathroom and cry, try to punch things or sometimes even punch myself in the leg or so. Oh, and don't get me started on the bed. When I am trying to fall asleep after I met these people it's the same reaction as with the ""second type of people"", just a million times worse. I often imagine myself in situations where I did something really shitty (**that didn't even happen**) and think about how I would try to apologize to them, and how much they'd hate me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to a few days ago. I (and my aforementioned 2 closest friends) went away for the weekend to meet up with some people of an organization we are part of. The first two days went mostly good. On the second day, we drank and stayed up until about 3 AM, and we had to get up at 9. Falling asleep was fairly easy, since it was very late and I was still drunk. (the ""anxiety voices"" completely disappear when I drink. But don't worry, I don't have a drinking problem, if that's what you're thinking. I never drink alone or to counter anxiety. And when I drink, I know my limits.)  


I awoke far too early, because I forgot to close the blinds and the sun shined into the room. It was probably about 7:30 at that point. But I wasn't feeling particularly tired, so I got up and wasted some time. After breakfast, we had a small discussion with about 10 people. Nothing really bad, until the conversation shifted to mental health problems. I listened for a bit, then excused myself and sat down on a sofa in a corner. I don't know why, but the fact that mental health was brought up really messed with me. My mood rapidly changed from ""good"" to ""shitty"" and that was the start of the longest and worst ""anxiety state"" yet. After a few minutes, I went to the bathroom and did all the things at once. I started to cry, I kicked a wall and the toilet and I punched myself multiple times. After some time, I was just lying on the floor not doing anything but crying. I figured that I couldn't stay forever this way, and got up, wiped off the tears and tried my best to look normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, the ""looking normal"" worked. But I did the ""bathroom thing"" multiple times over the next few hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted my friends to notice how I felt, to talk about it, but at the same time, I didn't want anyone else to know. Since I couldn't really find a reason for why I had these ""anxiety attacks"", I figured it must be because I'm an asshole and just looking for attention. But my friends did not notice. And that made me angry. Not at them, but at myself. And then I got even more angry at myself, because I'm just doing it for attention. And so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home that day, I sat down on my chair and started to play a game. Since it wasn't particularly gripping, I started to think about the day again. I thought how much of an asshole I had been to my friends. (And I still hold that to be true, more or less. I behaved in a pretty shitty way to them) I thought how stupid I was, how pathetic it was to cry in the bathroom. And then I did something I never did before. I took a pin and stung my finger with it. As punishment, and as a way of distracting from the emotional pain. But I got tired of stinging myself with a pin. So I took a pair of scissors. I tried to cut myself. Emphasis on ""tried"" because the scissors were pretty blunt. But it still left a small line.

&amp;#x200B;

I was taken aback by that. I couldn't believe what I had done. And then I did it again, and again, each time a bit harder. Then I gathered all my willpower and threw the scissors away. I ran out of the room. I then knew I had a problem. I've known for longer. But until then, I believed I could help myself. For the last few days, I felt lost. I looked up information about self harm on the internet, and tried my best to keep myself from doing it again. It was not enough though. I found myself looking for sharper objects in the kitchen (surprisingly without much luck), and I tried the scissors again. Even as I am writing this text, I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

I came to the conclusion that I absolutely need to talk to someone about this. IRL. I thought about seeing a therapist, but I really don't want to share my whole life with a complete stranger. I absolutely do not want my mother or father to know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk to one of my close friends. But I really don't know if I should. I know she'd support me, and do her best to help me. But at the same time, I also think she'd freak out, and it might even weigh on her, since she had mental health problems in the past as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm at a loss now. I'm convinced a therapist would help me, but I just don't want it. I don't really know why. I wouldn't know where to find one, how to hide it from my parents (although I'm no longer a minor) 

I feel like support from my friends would help a lot more.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigger warning: Self-harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is probably the 1 millionth post that&amp;#39;s like this but at this point, I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting off, last night I was having a really rough time, mentally.
For one of the first times ever, i just completely shut down. Luckily, through this, my girlfriend was there for me!! Over text at least.
Today, I'm still stuck on yesterday and I'm feeling awful. So I went back to my girlfriend. As someone who's relatively serious about these kinds of situations, I thought she'd understand.
I texted her about how my eyes are swollen (from last nights events) and that I'm still in a rough spot. All she responded with was the dreaded ""Oof"" text.

I hate that response with a PASSION. It just feels like a quick way to say ""Uuuh, ok? Whatever, i don't care""

So please, how do I respond to this? I've never dropped so low before and I'm not sure how to redirect the conversation to something more ""serious"". I really need her support, but I just can't figure anything out. Help?

TL;DR
My girlfriend responded to my bad mental health update with ""Oof"". How do I respond?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting off, last night I was having a really rough time, mentally.

Today, I&amp;#39;m still stuck on yesterday and I&amp;#39;m feeling awful. So I went back to my girlfriend. As someone who&amp;#39;s relatively serious about these kinds of situations, I thought she&amp;#39;d understand.
I texted her about how my eyes are swollen (from last nights events) and that I&amp;#39;m still in a rough spot. All she responded with was the dreaded &amp;quot;Oof&amp;quot; text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that response with a PASSION. It just feels like a quick way to say &amp;quot;Uuuh, ok? Whatever, i don&amp;#39;t care&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, how do I respond to this? I&amp;#39;ve never dropped so low before and I&amp;#39;m not sure how to redirect the conversation to something more &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;. I really need her support, but I just can&amp;#39;t figure anything out. Help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR
My girlfriend responded to my bad mental health update with &amp;quot;Oof&amp;quot;. How do I respond?&lt;/p&gt;

I have been working on this anxiety for a long while. But I feel stuck. Every time it feels like I made progress it feels like I go right back to getting scared and upset whenever I play games with others. (TLDR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I was playing a game with my partner. I was scared to say I wanted to start with the tutorial first so I don't fully feel lost and overwhelmed. But he remembered this time after a bit. I was very grateful and felt silly for feeling afraid to ask. But I was having a hard time learning the move combos. Af first when I declined him asking for the remote to help me figure out the pattern he seemed understanding. It put me on edge tho thinking I was being mentally timed and was starting to take too long to figure it out. Thus I began to get increasingly upset and scared I'm too slow which made it increasingly harder for me to comprehend simple instructions. I can't think well when I'm starting to panic.  He has Aspergers so thinks the best way to help is to take away what he feels is upsetting me. So asked more and more for the controller so he can figure it out to help offer me tips for the character I picked. I got very upset and frustrated since I kept trying to explain I need to do it on my own or I'll feel stupid and incompetent for always needing hand holding.We ran out of time and he had to go. but I feel horrible that I got upset and in a panic over a game again. I feel very embarrassed. But I have no idea what we can do differently. I tried suggesting things like ""Don't offer so much help, let me ask for it"" I don't mind tips, what I do mind is the control being taken from me since then I can't learn by making mistakes. For example, when I'm learning a game I prefer doing everything since If I don't my brain doesn't record it. Making it harder for me to do again later. But me explaining this made him say ""Then am I not supposed to play the game? Just follow you and fight a little beside you?"" I hated it but I said yes that's honestly exactly what I need when learning a game with someone who already knows the game. When I play a game I know with someone who doesn't know it I do exactly that. I'll follow them completely and just point out stuff if it looks they'll miss it.But when I am playing a new game with someone who knows it I feel like dead weight when they run off or open most of the loot or take the controls from me if I can't do it fast enough. I keep trying to explain that I really don't care about failing missions and such over and over. I'm used to it and accept it as a learning experience to try again with. He says he understands and agrees, but some things affect the game later on too. Which I honestly still don't care too much about. If I mess up, I mess up. To me, There's nothing stopping me from just making a new save file and trying again. Except for other people who seem frustrated over it.But he keeps saying ""I'm autistic, I can't help it."" Which I get it, I have high anxiety I can't help but go into an embarrassing panic over tiny pressures whether intentional or not. I keep trying to explain that I'm just pointing out what I can tell set off my fears so we can work on them. but he just wants to keep saying he can't word perfectly and can't help it. It might have been in the heat of the moment since he has worked on the way he words some other things over time. Or at least catches himself and says ""Wait that came out bad give me a moment."" As he takes a bit to think of a better way to phrase whatever he was saying to not sound rude or out of pocket. Which I don't mind. I appreciate it and am sure to let him know thank you take all the time you need to come up with a way to say it. I rather he took his time to say something than to say something that sounds like a jab.

&amp;#x200B;

I getting off subject a bit. But I'm unsure what I or we can do to work on my anxiety with feeling timed with, not just games, but anything honestly.  Even at my retail job I start breaking out in a cold sweat and am told I look nervous at times if I start helping too many impatient customers. They get so antsy and sigh about ""slow computers"" ""slow counting"" (when I'm figuring out how i want to give back their change if they decide to change up what amount they want to give me after I already told the register they gave me 20 and then they pull out 17 or something, saying to use this instead.) I tried started saying ""you already gave me this and I rung it up this way"" To avoid taking more time to find a calculator and plug it all in since I can't think when put on the spot like that. But if a coworker overhears me they run over to say I can do it and then figure out the change really quickly for me. I feel embarrassed and incompetent then. But struggle to explain to them that I need to do it that way for myself since when people are watching me I struggle to think or remember things. Luckily my boss understands as she has a husband with high anxiety too and tells me to do what's comfortable to me, if they don't like waiting a few extra seconds for me to do my job then they can go to the other store around the corner. Similar to how I'm more comfortable asking for ID for everyone who looks younger regardless if I recognize them or not. It's just easier for me. But so many people like to get age restricted items and ""forget"" their ID... is it really that hard to just have it on you? but they get so antsy and my coworkers pressure me with ""it's fine they're a regular"" I feel stuck and like I can't be rude or 'no fun' since they seem to be friends with my coworkers or know them. But I don't think I'm being no fun by asking for something you should already have on you... Plus I rather not risk going to prison you know. On regular already seemed to stop coming in cause of my always asking for ID tho so I'm nervous. Her last visite she huffed with ""The other store never askes for my ID."" after having to go to her car to get it for the second time. MY coworkers did have my back with her saying ""then go to the other store"" but not with everyone it seems. I really fail to understand why so many people wouldn't bring ID with them. Especially if they know they look younger. (funny to me to see them with these bug stuffed wallets with a social security card in it, but for some reason not their ID tho)

I'll start by listing the things my social anxiety has stopped me from doing, from most severe (what I really wish I could do) to not so severe (it's annoying but I don't dwell on it):

1. Messaging people first
2. Exercising
3. Wearing short clothing in public
4. Meeting potential partners
5. Needing alcohol to speak to people I don't know too well
6.Going out at night

The most horrifying thing that I deal with is never messaging friends first, since I am always under the impression that I'm bothering them, and that they don't want to speak to me. I'm always ""alert"" for subtle cues that they make in order to confirm my suspicions. A friend of mine never responds anyway so I've stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch. In my defence, any time I do message first, they rarely respond and if I try to make plans, they never accept. I found out recently that they made plans without me which definitely hurt. I suppose I'm looking for a fresh perspective on the situation.

I don't exercise. At all. My local park is always full of people so I don't go there, and the gym is always full and leads into my next issue (short clothing). I don't like the way I run - I imagine myself to be like Phoebe from Friends.

I can't wear short clothing in public. Shorts, T-Shirts what have you. I feel the need to cover every part of me that I can. Doesn't matter if it's 100¬∞ out, I'll still be wearing a sweatshirt and jeans.

I'm 21 and have been single my entire life because I'm absolutely terrified of rejection from others. I've never asked a girl out, or even spoken to one in more than a platonic manner.

The last two aren't such an issue, though as I say, they're annoying.

The thing is, I've got a degree in Psychology, and know that the best way to do it is through exposure, but even the thought of it sends my heart racing.

In addition, I've overcome Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in the past but cannot seem to fix my current issues.

Can anyone offer any advice, or even just a comment/perspective?

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is the right place to share this, and probably sounds all too familiar to most of you, at least some of it may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start by listing the things my social anxiety has stopped me from doing, from most severe (what I really wish I could do) to not so severe (it&amp;#39;s annoying but I don&amp;#39;t dwell on it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging people first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearing short clothing in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting potential partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing alcohol to speak to people I don&amp;#39;t know too well
6.Going out at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most horrifying thing that I deal with is never messaging friends first, since I am always under the impression that I&amp;#39;m bothering them, and that they don&amp;#39;t want to speak to me. I&amp;#39;m always &amp;quot;alert&amp;quot; for subtle cues that they make in order to confirm my suspicions. A friend of mine never responds anyway so I&amp;#39;ve stopped trying, even though I would love to keep up the friendship. My old friends from high school never messaged me first so I convinced myself that I upset them, so we eventually lost touch. In my defence, any time I do message first, they rarely respond and if I try to make plans, they never accept. I found out recently that they made plans without me which definitely hurt. I suppose I&amp;#39;m looking for a fresh perspective on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

You needed to pass both tests in each section in order to get any qualification. After the last test I felt as if I had failed for sure and started to think of things I thought I had missed. I was certain I had missed one key thing.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t smoke weed (anymore) but take CBD oil every now and then which seems to be helping overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Does anyone have any experience with becoming worryingly infatuated with someone? I‚Äôm not talking a cute little crush (or maybe I am, but it‚Äôs playing out differently in my anxious brain), but more like a real obsession that you just can‚Äôt silence?

I‚Äôve (27F) had this happen a few times in many years ago in high school with teachers, I‚Äôd just get obsessed with them and borderline stalk them (always try to be places where I could ‚Äúbump into them‚Äù etc), constantly fantasize about hypothetical conversations, connections or moments together. I did have genuine connections with both of them, and a particularly strong connection with the one I was most obsessed with. Even then I could recognize that this was unhealthy, but the more I tried to push it away, the more viciously it occupied my mind.

Now, about 10 years later I‚Äôve found myself in a similar situation again and honestly quite scared by it. 

There is a woman at my work who I admire, and definitely do have a crush on (she‚Äôs super cool, articulate, soft and beautiful), but it‚Äôs beyond a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù crush at this point. I feel like my mind is forcing thoughts upon me that I could usually brush off and get on with my day, but it‚Äôs like they are demanding my attention. I find myself wanting to bump into her all the time and to connect more with her on a personal level (our relationship is entirely professional, though we are definitely vibe when I‚Äôm not an anxious mess).

Last night I had a dream about her and then had to work in a pair with her today and I just feel so creepy and weird that she‚Äôs constantly on my mind, and that my desire to get her off my mind is probably what is feeding the whole vicious cycle.

In brief, my dad committed suicide on July 29th 2018 and since then my life has been hectic and bringing up a lot of childhood trauma in not only me but in my mom and brother. I'm moving out with my brother (m19) to the town D lives in at the beginning of September and I'll actually be right around the corner from him. 

D and his sisters have mitochondrial disease, his 17 year old sister is disabled and is actually dying from it currently. Him and his other two younger sisters have been in and out of the hospital for problems related to their condition as well. On top of this his dying sister was also molested coming up two years ago by their moms then boyfriend (I was involved as the sister confided in me first). 

We have both been to therapy for our separate problems but currently I am very very broke and can't afford a therapist. 

For the first time in my life I've realized I have an anxious attachment style. I'm constantly on guard and looking for little signals that my relationship to D is in trouble. I get anxious at read receipts and if he doesn't like my photos etc right away, I'm really really just not chilled out and I worry excessively about it when there's nothing to worry about. 

This attachment style is a result of my parents being inconsistent with their love for me as a child. My first and second relationship also has reinforced this - when I was 14 my first boyfriend and I texted from good morning to good night like every few minutes. Always in contact. And then when I was 17 until I was 19 my then boyfriend had a dismissive-avoidant attachment style and we fought a lot. Near the end he would ignore me on purpose and it was a time where I was always on guard and having to see what little signals he was sending me (were we okay? Was he mad? What was he feeling? I almost never knew). 

Then comes D, sweet as hell and perfect for me. I love his family and they love me, we're all very close and I have unconditional love for these people. But of course we have a lot of trauma and not enough coping mechanisms. D is terrible at communicating and he knows this and is working on it.

This summer it's my goal before I move to work on my relationship anxiety as much as I can. Im looking for general advice, tips and tricks even. I find my brain always moving into anxious mode, and even when I look at the facts and tell myself there's nothing to worry about, I usually find it's still hard to shift my perspective. Sometimes I'm successful, but then maybe an hour or two later I slip back. 

I really truly wanna focus on myself and make a solid foundation mentally. I think about love too much, some days it's all I think about. 

tl;dr my friend and I both have feelings for each other but aren't together as we're both healing from separate traumas. This summer before I move closer to him (and just start a new part of my life in general) I want to work on not being anxiously attached in my relationships and want to work on turning around my thinking.

I easily become anxious ever since I started college in 2015. It gets worse every time I study. I have this feeling of drowning and not being able to breathe every time I study (probably bc of the fear that I cant finish it, even though I already studied it enough to pass the tests). There were times that I would wake up catching my breath because of it. And most of the times, I just cry. I am afraid to open up to anyone because I'm afraid they might call me ""overreacting"", but this feeling really is difficult for me. 


Today, I just realized that because of my anxiety, I can never go into med school (which is my dream). I could never imagine myself going through all that. I'm thinking, ""I cant even survive this pre med course, how can I survive medicine??"" I know that some people may say, ""You'll get use to it."" But, that wasn't the case for me. I can never be under a great amount of stress, I don't know what can happen to me. And the thought even scares me.

Me: How was your day? 

Her: Crash and burn. 

Me: Bad day? 

Her: Not really lol 

Me: That's okay. The baseball team crashed and burned too. Bummer. 

Her: Lol Me: Alright I'll let you go. Talk later this week? 

Her: Ok lol you must be busy. 

Me: A little bit but not too bad. I always have time for you. 

Her: Oh boy

Right around the same time, I was on Facebook messenger (which is like text messaging) with a male friend of hers. Their relationship is more like brother-sister and they have been friends for almost two decades. He mentioned he was with my SO and they were hanging out. He and I get along pretty well but it made me uneasy. 

I should also mentioned that the weekend before I met her family and her mother gave me a hug when greeting hello and when saying goodbye. I also posted a picture on Facebook, which my SO liked and she even sent me an invite through Facebook.

Was this just a miscommunication, a plan that never actually happened or something more? Am I reading too much into this or should I worry?

About two months ago, my car got towed from the apartment building parking lot (I had been begging my boyfriend for a parking pass for about a year and I had been worrying about this happening). Once this happened, he finally put me on the lease and got me a parking pass. 

Now that I was on the lease, I didn‚Äôt renew my mail forwarding. Only I didn‚Äôt know that they would literally stop sending you mail. 

I recently had surgery and maxed out my healthcare deductible. My job as a health reimbursement account, which is great. It covers a significant portion of my medical bills. The benefits company keeps sending me the check, but the post office has been refusing to deliver it. 

I went on USPS to update my info, but it takes 7-10 days to completely be updated. 

I also applied to graduate school. I was contacted by the department head that I got in, but I have not received an official email from the graduate school. I‚Äôm very nervous that the graduate school mailed my acceptance to me and that the post office sent it back.

I'm very careful about what I look at online. I've distanced myself from a lot of friends because I felt like I was falling behind on the road to success and didn't feel like I could relate to them anymore.

People have called me a worry-wort. Anxiety is not something I want in my life, but it's always there in the back of my mind. I have to orient my daily routine just to make sure that it's under control. Meditation and taking the time to let my brain ease up so it can start to function normally again (I enjoy playing singleplayer games that don't require me to think about the game itself too much, moreso just something to do with my hands).

I recently moved abroad for three months to teach English. I‚Äôve wanted to do this for years and finally had the savings and time so decided to do it this summer. 

But since I got here I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my life as a whole and how flawed it is and how I‚Äôve made so many mistakes before and how I will keep on repeating them.

I‚Äôve been here about six weeks now and I‚Äôve managed to diminish most of that negative self talk through CBT methods and affirmations but now I can‚Äôt seem to get over the thought of how much time I‚Äôve wasted so far with that anxious bullshit. I‚Äôm so furious at myself for wasting half of my previous time here on negativity and not being happy. In my head my time here was meant to be perfect (unrealistic I know), and I was meant to feel mostly happy, not mostly anxious. I‚Äôve become obsessive about not forgiving myself for this, and it kinda feels like this is my brains excuse not to move on/feel better.

Does anyone have any advice for how to just allow yourself/ give yourself permission to let go of the anxiety and guilt for even feeling anxiety in the first place?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved abroad for three months to teach English. I‚Äôve wanted to do this for years and finally had the savings and time so decided to do it this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I got here I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my life as a whole and how flawed it is and how I‚Äôve made so many mistakes before and how I will keep on repeating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been here about six weeks now and I‚Äôve managed to diminish most of that negative self talk through CBT methods and affirmations but now I can‚Äôt seem to get over the thought of how much time I‚Äôve wasted so far with that anxious bullshit. I‚Äôm so furious at myself for wasting half of my previous time here on negativity and not being happy. In my head my time here was meant to be perfect (unrealistic I know), and I was meant to feel mostly happy, not mostly anxious. I‚Äôve become obsessive about not forgiving myself for this, and it kinda feels like this is my brains excuse not to move on/feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to relax and enjoy myself but I can‚Äôt seem to let myself. I feel like a freak for not being 100% when living abroad, because I feel like everyone else in this situation is.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll do something super minor 

- not do something when someone asked out of being forgetful  

- forget something someone said and or do the wrong thing 


- not respond to someone or forget to respond to them, and they get a little testy with me 


- if someone isn't talking to me or takes long to reply, or call me back, etc, I will get nervous they are upset with me, and or I did something wrong until they respond. I never get mad at anyone, I just sit and wonder over and over until I speak to them again. 


I hate that I do this so much, It pretty much started when I got this extremely toxic friend, who would get mad at me over the stupidest of things, I knew him for 7 years until I cut ties with him, and just couldn't take his shit anymore.  Now I associate everyone's aggravated or just even normal behavior with me, that they are upset with me. 

I obviously try to talk myself out of it, and tell myself it's not rational, and literally every single time, it ends up fine and I just have this stupid fear. This is why I really dislike social media, but I can't leave it because sadly (but also good) its my job. 

Also whenever anyone, my friends or people I'm associated with, tweet or say anything vague like ""I don't know why I even bothered"" or ""I knew you were that way"" I will automatically assume its about me. 

This really wouldn't be a problem but it severely effects my daily schedule, I will procrastinate on things I need to get done to obsess over people being upset with me.

I work for a rather larger company in California and the basis of my job is cleaning. I am often alone for these duties without a higher up supervision as it is a very large workplace. This however doesn‚Äôt mean I interact with the people who come to our establishment. There are thousands of them on a daily basis. On any given day I can be truly alone for a few minutes of my shift. 
My anxiety has always affected my ability to perform, even on days without a panic attack it‚Äôs always at the back of my mind. Questions like, will it start? Will this cause it to start? Will I be able to finish today without an incident. 
Now I‚Äôve been to my doctor for this same situation last year and she recommended therapists for me to see but as soon as I got word back to my employer I was placed on a four month leave and given a new position when I returned. 
Now, the thing with my anxiety is that I can‚Äôt wake up and go to work like most people do. I have to jump through multiple hoops. I can do this just fine on regular days. 
The thing is those hoops are horrible and will affect my body in the long run. I do not want to quit as I have financial responsibilities such as my car. While I do still live with my parents and they don‚Äôt charge rent, this will not be the case forever.  
For starters, If i work a typical day my shift will usually be afternoon to late night. Something like 16:00-00:30. 
Recently I‚Äôve been calling out and going home early because my anxiety takes a turn for the worst and I‚Äôm left shaking and close to hyperventilating over what seen small problems. I often tough it out alone and hope nobody notices. We employ thousands of people in just my sight and so far it‚Äôs been unnoticed when I slip away for a few minutes to calm down but I definitely feel horrible about stopping my work. 
To be able to complete my shift with little to no anxiety I can‚Äôt eat at all before work. By the time I get home I‚Äôm stressed out and can only eat a little and the stress I feel in turn has crippled my sleeping habits. I usually sleep from 2:00-7:30 now most days. I wake up not feeling rested and in general feel tired and lethargic the entire day.
I know it‚Äôs slowly going to kill me but this is the only way I can comfortably work. I‚Äôve been doing this for almost two years and I‚Äôm underweight and slightly depressed and pessimistic about my future. 
With that out of the way....I have confided in a leader at my workplace and he strongly recommended I place a request for a medical leave. To not only help with my anxiety but also get to a healthy weight and fix my habits. This has been going on for years even back when I was in high school not eating would help me stay calm and finish the school day. 
Quitting would be the least favorable option as I do not want to burden my parents with car payments I can‚Äôt pay once the little I have in savings is used up. 
I‚Äôm sorry if this is very convoluted, it‚Äôs early in the morning and my thoughts are everywhere. 
Will also be immensely grateful for advice following a break from work, hospital advice, talking to a therapist advice, medication advice, any advice. I‚Äôm a very isolated person who feels they can‚Äôt turn toward anyone close for an ear to listen. 
Thank you so much in advance.

Quitting would be the least favorable option as I do not want to burden my parents with car payments I can‚Äôt pay once the little I have in savings is used up. 
I‚Äôm sorry if this is very convoluted, it‚Äôs early in the morning and my thoughts are everywhere. 
Will also be immensely grateful for advice following a break from work, hospital advice, talking to a therapist advice, medication advice, any advice. I‚Äôm a very isolated person who feels they can‚Äôt turn toward anyone close for an ear to listen. 
Thank you so much in advance.

Like the title says I have been really stuck on trying to be more courageous over the last 8 months. I have struggled with anxiety all of my life off and on. I struggle with fear of failure, pain, confrontation (because I'm a small framed guy and skinny), and finances. 

I know some will find this humourous, but I have really looked up to the superhero Captain America since the beginning of the marvel movies. I'm inspired by his dedication and the courage that he shows even when the odds are against him.
My favorite thing about him is when he's getting beat up and his opponent is surprised that he hasn't quit yet he simply says *I could do this all day* when you're looking at him thinking he definitely couldn't.

I know this is Hollywood, only a movie, and it's a superhero, but what can I do to have more courage and stop being so afraid? I want to be inspirational to people rather than just being afraid. I want to inspire myself instead of being embarrassed that I have no bravery.

But I tried and I applied to a few. Some took some time to get back to me....rejection emails and some no response at all. I did get one where I had to do some online written interview. I was then contacted by HR, they had a few question regarding something in my resume and asked me what days I am available for interview if I my written interview was fine. 

......i just feel like shit. I got so nervous and was stuttering during that call. it wasn't even a interview.even after the interview, my heart was still racing.

I have for about 3 years been dealing with anxiety that has progressively gotten worse. It started with me starting highschool (in Sweden) and life quickly went from an unexplored world of opportunities to a world of uncertainties. Things that I had looked forward to became scary and everything became too much. 
To summarize how things got worse during the 3 years it was basically school being the constant stress factor that it is and mixed up in all that were some family issues and girlfriends that to abruptly became ex's.
In the end I just didn't go to school for days. The days quickly became weeks and eventually I hadn't been to school for 2 months. At that time it was nearing graduation times and because I hadn't been to school but instead stayed at home trying to escape from reality my grades had dropped significantly and I had trouble talking to my friends. I want to clarify that my friends were supportive but since I hadn't talked to any of them for such a long time it just felt awkward meeting them. It felt like my defining characteristic was that I had been gone from school for 2-3 months.

All this said I still went to school the last week somehow and I did graduate. I did talk to my friends even though it was awkward at first. I am about to go on a trip with some of those very friends tomorrow actually. In the end  I am feeling relieved that I made it through the last stretch in highschool. 

With that said my anxiety is still here and because I ate a lot of junk food to comfort myself and didn't go to the gym. I now have stretch marks all over my body and instead of weighing 80-85 kg I weigh 110 kg (188 cm tall). This is not exactly a thing that makes me more confident about finding a partner.

&lt;p&gt;I have for about 3 years been dealing with anxiety that has progressively gotten worse. It started with me starting highschool (in Sweden) and life quickly went from an unexplored world of opportunities to a world of uncertainties. Things that I had looked forward to became scary and everything became too much. 
To summarize how things got worse during the 3 years it was basically school being the constant stress factor that it is and mixed up in all that were some family issues and girlfriends that to abruptly became ex&amp;#39;s.
In the end I just didn&amp;#39;t go to school for days. The days quickly became weeks and eventually I hadn&amp;#39;t been to school for 2 months. At that time it was nearing graduation times and because I hadn&amp;#39;t been to school but instead stayed at home trying to escape from reality my grades had dropped significantly and I had trouble talking to my friends. I want to clarify that my friends were supportive but since I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to any of them for such a long time it just felt awkward meeting them. It felt like my defining characteristic was that I had been gone from school for 2-3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said I still went to school the last week somehow and I did graduate. I did talk to my friends even though it was awkward at first. I am about to go on a trip with some of those very friends tomorrow actually. In the end  I am feeling relieved that I made it through the last stretch in highschool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said my anxiety is still here and because I ate a lot of junk food to comfort myself and didn&amp;#39;t go to the gym. I now have stretch marks all over my body and instead of weighing 80-85 kg I weigh 110 kg (188 cm tall). This is not exactly a thing that makes me more confident about finding a partner. That coupled with the overwhelming pressure to decide what to do with my life is at the moment the biggest contributors to my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to rant anonymously to someone about my issues and after writing this I do feel a tad bit better. Let&amp;#39;s hope it stays that way. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm on antidepressants and honestly they make me feel SO much better, I have energy now and I'm able to concentrate but I'm still struggling with school.

I'm honestly really trying to look at this at a positive light as I have to attend a workshop on ""success tools"" or whatever and I hope that I can actually learn something from it and maybe have this ordeal spur me into action.

It gives me a lot of anxiety as I fear that I'll never be employable or even be able to live at this rate, I'm just frozen with fear. I feel like such a disappointment to my parents as well, but especially my mom who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer 2 years ago, I just don't know how long she has (she's doing really good, but cancer is unpredictable) and I would honestly NEVER forgive myself if she never got to see me graduate or move on from school, just the thought makes me want to throw up.

I've always never really liked school but I've always done well enough, I did AP in high school and got decent grades (besides my senior year, but that's another story lol). I'm majoring in computer science and at this point I'm just thinking of getting some IT certifications &amp; interning or something and just skipping out on a degree or even just going into an unrelated trade.

I have had this nagging feeling the last few years that something from my life was missing. I have trouble
staying truly present. My mind was tied up with my anxious thoughts. I am pretty sure I have Generalized  Anxiety Disorder. Lots of things trigger me these days (flying, driving, conflict, whining, dying, cleaning, among other unpredictable daily events).


I am still struggling, but I am not alone. I am grateful to have positive outlets to assist me when I am feeling unbalanced. I have written poems, talked to therapists, practiced yoga, leaned on my family and friends for support, and even taken medication to help alleviate my anxiety. I couldn't understand what was going on with me. I thought it was my fault. It turns out that I do not have any control over my thoughts. I am not my thoughts. It is NOT my fault. And it is not yours either. Please know that.


I am going to share some things that have helped me, along with some of my poems.

Since apparently that‚Äôs still of potential concern, any recommendations on controlling this?  I can do breathing techniques and things in known ‚Äúwhite coat‚Äù situations, but this information suggest I ought to work on stress response management in daily life.  Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

This weekend, my sister came to town and I finally conjured up the balls to tell her what‚Äôs been going in with me. The last month and a half have been miserable. Thankfully, she was incredibly helpful and thoughtfully concerned. We went to Whole Foods to look for some natural remedies - to find anything to take some of the edge off. We filled up a basket with some stuff i‚Äôd never heard of and went to the register. 

The 2 things I got that I am incredibly amazed with:

1. Anxie-t by LifeSeasons. I take 2 of these things in the morning and can feel my anxiety subside drastically. Not totally, but we‚Äôre talking going from an 8 or 9 down to a 3 or 4. I highly recommend them. Also available on Amazon!

2. Calm by Natural Vitality. This is a magnesium supplement you mix with a glass of water to promote stress relief. I read an article saying that anxiety can come from low magnesium levels and our bodies don‚Äôt naturally create magnesium. I read that the magnesium can promote brain function. Don‚Äôt quote me on that, though. I was told by a worker at Whole Foods that if you‚Äôre consistent with taking it at night - it‚Äôll help a lot overall. Worth a shot.

Hope this helps! I am no stranger to looking for relief but hate the idea of medication. But as I get older i realize you‚Äôve gotta do what you gotta do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all. for what it‚Äôs worth, i‚Äôm 26 years old

The comment I linked to above was a great one about how your emotions are always valid. I'm just going to quote u/reallybigleg here, because it's simpler this way:

&gt;Also, I've spent some time speaking with secure friends about this since I left my last relationship because I couldn't get my needs met. What they pointed out that I do that they don't do is try to understand and justify my needs before I explain them and then I'm very 'soft' in asking for them. This comes from my self doubt as to whether my feeling are important and my worry that I am being unreasonable for feeling them. My secure friends say they often don't know exactly why they feel what they feel and that they work it out from the conversation itself. They feel bad, they simply say they feel bad. Then their partner talks with them until they've worked out why and what to do. They do not date people who ask them to justify that feeling. They are incredibly offended by this position. What do you mean justify? **I** feel bad. **Me**. The difference is that people with a high self esteem automatically believe their emotional welfare (and that of their partner) is top priority. They will not tolerate anything less.

My question is, **yes, your emotions may be valid, but what if you are making unreasonable requests of others based on those emotions?** For example: An anxious person may feel anxious/unhappy/insecure if they don't hear from their partner once an hour, but that doesn't mean the solution is to expect the partner to communicate with them once an hour. Sure, the anxious person's feelings are valid, but the action they might request based on those feelings is not reasonable or rational. The catch is, anxious people probably don't realize this, and we end up making these types of irrational requests in an effort to make ourselves feel better or more secure. 

I think many anxious types probably feel blind to what actually IS unreasonable pretty regularly. Maybe some of us feel uncomfortable and hesitant in asking for what would make us feel secure, because we're aware we've made irrational requests in the past.

So, **I'm wondering if others here have any tips for learning how to recognize when you're making an irrational / unfair / unreasonable request**. People can't have their therapists follow them around all day saying, ""This is rational, that's not. This is, that's not."" People need strategies to be self-sufficient... I wonder what those are?

How are anxious people supposed to feel confident in asking for what we want/need when we know we have a history of making irrational / unfair / unreasonable requests in the past?

Sorry for such a long post but I'd super appreciate your opinions.

Basically, my boyfriend really wants me to try taking an anti-depressant and this has been a cause of a lot of stress in our relationship. I suffer from severe anxiety. It bleeds into almost everything in my life even though I've improved a lot over the years. I'm 26 but I've had social anxiety as well as OCD and general anxiety since I was around 11. My boyfriend has social anxiety as well and some other anxieties but they aren't as severe. He takes Citalopram. He really wants me to try giving that medication a go but I have major anxiety with that because of course I do, lol. I even have anxiety with swallowing pills. I take goodie powder instead of tylenol because I'm worried it'll get stuck in my throat. I'm sure that's just anxiety but sometimes I think I have a legit issue with swallowing or something. I can't chug things like most people, for instance. But maybe that's all in my head.

Anyway, as for the medicine, I am terrified of having allergic reactions and of potential side effects. I also always wanted to try to get to the root of the problems and try to solve them instead of covering up symptoms with medication. And I've improved a lot by doing just that but it doesn't matter because I'm still so bad off. And that's my boyfriend's argument for me to take them... that my anxiety is too much for me to try to sort through without some extra help from medication. He believes in getting to the root as well but that I need something to take the edge off and make it easier to help myself. We've had this discussion so many times now and I've always ended up not willing to try it because of how scared I am and how I want to go the more natural route.

I've had some pretty awful reactions to medications in the past and I worry that I'm more sensitive and likely to experience awful side effects. And in my mind, the risk of a severe allergic reaction (even though I know that's really unlikely) or awful side effects or even long term issues just doesn't feel worth it for something that I know could get a lot better without it... but it's to the point that if I don't try it, I will lose my boyfriend. And I understand that because I do affect him. He affects me too, but it's not on the same level and he does take medication. But he's let me know that at some point he fully expects me to try it and that he won't accept it if I don't, unless I can convince him that I have sound, rational reasons for not trying it. I feel like I do have some rational reasons but a hard time presenting them. But maybe it really just boils down to being terrified.

I've come close to trying it just for him and just so we can stop revisiting this subject because it's always extremely stressful to me but if I try it, I want it to be because I want to and because it seems worth it to me. If I try it, I want it to be for myself, not just for him

I know there's a possibility that the medicine could really make a difference, but I feel like most of it comes from CBT and really digging into the problems and working through them. I get that medication can make that easier to do, but you have to go through all the trial and error of multiple pills sometimes and side effects from that just to find the right one. Maybe Citalopram will work out and be a great fit for me, but maybe it won't make any difference and I have to deal with being miserable for a while. And I know coming off an anti-depressant can be pretty bad even if you've only taken it a short period of time.

I guess I'm just hoping to see different people's views on this and that it will help me with my decision. Maybe this time I'll actually give it a go, but I don't know how to not have a panic attack after taking it worrying about how my body might react.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Sorry for such a long post but I&amp;#39;d super appreciate your opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, my boyfriend really wants me to try taking an anti-depressant and this has been a cause of a lot of stress in our relationship. I suffer from severe anxiety. It bleeds into almost everything in my life even though I&amp;#39;ve improved a lot over the years. I&amp;#39;m 26 but I&amp;#39;ve had social anxiety as well as OCD and general anxiety since I was around 11. My boyfriend has social anxiety as well and some other anxieties but they aren&amp;#39;t as severe. He takes Citalopram. He really wants me to try giving that medication a go but I have major anxiety with that because of course I do, lol. I even have anxiety with swallowing pills. I take goodie powder instead of tylenol because I&amp;#39;m worried it&amp;#39;ll get stuck in my throat. I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s just anxiety but sometimes I think I have a legit issue with swallowing or something. I can&amp;#39;t chug things like most people, for instance. But maybe that&amp;#39;s all in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as for the medicine, I am terrified of having allergic reactions and of potential side effects. I also always wanted to try to get to the root of the problems and try to solve them instead of covering up symptoms with medication. And I&amp;#39;ve improved a lot by doing just that but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because I&amp;#39;m still so bad off. And that&amp;#39;s my boyfriend&amp;#39;s argument for me to take them... that my anxiety is too much for me to try to sort through without some extra help from medication. He believes in getting to the root as well but that I need something to take the edge off and make it easier to help myself. We&amp;#39;ve had this discussion so many times now and I&amp;#39;ve always ended up not willing to try it because of how scared I am and how I want to go the more natural route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had some pretty awful reactions to medications in the past and I worry that I&amp;#39;m more sensitive and likely to experience awful side effects. And in my mind, the risk of a severe allergic reaction (even though I know that&amp;#39;s really unlikely) or awful side effects or even long term issues just doesn&amp;#39;t feel worth it for something that I know could get a lot better without it... but it&amp;#39;s to the point that if I don&amp;#39;t try it, I will lose my boyfriend. And I understand that because I do affect him. He affects me too, but it&amp;#39;s not on the same level and he does take medication. But he&amp;#39;s let me know that at some point he fully expects me to try it and that he won&amp;#39;t accept it if I don&amp;#39;t, unless I can convince him that I have sound, rational reasons for not trying it. I feel like I do have some rational reasons but a hard time presenting them. But maybe it really just boils down to being terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

I went out last night with my friend (let's say her name is Amy) and two other male friends. We are all around 19 years old. We were determined to have a good night and decided to each take half a pill alongside our drink. We have done this with each other a fair few times without mishap and we trust each other completely.

Within about 20 minutes Amy started reacting badly, she was throwing up and also had a panic attack which made it worse. I had to hold her while she passed out multiple times on me. She was begging for the ambulance. We called it and I had to sit with her while they ran tests. She was barely coherent and kept mumbling about feeling  like she was dying. 

I spent 5 hours in total in the ambulance and hospital sat by Amy, holding her hand, watching her cry and holding her during a pretty rough comedown. The boys sat in the waiting room for most of it but they gave me a break towards the end. We all left the hospital together at 5.30am today. (Amy is now okay, we think the panic attack enhanced the bad reaction as the rest of us were fine throughout).

The thing is, it's *her* traumatic experience not mine. I feel awful that I'm feeling so anxious by it. I haven't told her how the nights affected me but since I got home I haven't settled, my chest hurts each time I breathe and I keep struggling to keep my breath slow. I've been fighting panic attacks all day. My head feels like a mess but I can't tell her because she should be feeling worse, she was the one who went through it not me. I've got a lot of awful stuff going on in my life and I feel like last night has just tipped me into a wreck. I don't know what to do. Am I wrong for feeling so stressed about it? I'm still looking after her now and I've not told anyone that I'm not coping.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, might be a long one.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't panic constantly at work, panic attacks are pretty much gone, it really has made a difference. 

However, theres still one thing that I cannot shake, and that is worried thoughts. I mean, it's to the point where its obsessive.

It started with the one and only relationship i've ever had, the one time someone has really fallen in love with me.

On the last few months when problems started I suffered my first anxiety attack while working. From that day I started experiencing anxiety on lower levels, but in a lot of moments. 

It was really difficult to get over the break up, a long process with a lot of anxiety, feeling down and low self-esteem. But I did it. A few months later i met another girl, and everything seemed to go pretty well but then she took advantage of me and just disappeared, and in that moment with me being weak emotionally, it totally broke me. Started re-thinking all my life and really not wanting to meet anyone else ever again. It just hurt a lot once again. 

And here I am right now, a few months later, not feeling super confident, just dealing with it.

I am stubborn as hell üòÇ  Recently though, I have started considering seeing a psychologist. Mostly because I am in a new relationship with an amazing hooman.

Long story short, I‚Äôm two days out from becoming a father, while also tackling a new career with a lot of responsibility. I was jobless for nearly nine months with a kid on the way, and though that just getting a job would put my mind at ease and alleviate my stress/anxiety.

I started to notice last month that it‚Äôs affecting me physically now, and it‚Äôs never happened before in my life. I‚Äôm finding I‚Äôm not hungry often. Eating makes me feel sick. I‚Äôve started losing weight cuz of the stress, and for a skinny dude, that‚Äôs a little out of the ordinary. I‚Äôm also breaking out in itchy sores on my hands, and I‚Äôm tired constantly.

I don‚Äôt want to be this way, and when I really think about it, there‚Äôs nothing bad about either of the things going on. They‚Äôre both good, but I still feel the way I do. 

Part of me understands that a lot of it is due to everything being so new and unknown. Given some time, I‚Äôll grow accustomed to it all and feel better.

&lt;p&gt;I started to notice last month that it‚Äôs affecting me physically now, and it‚Äôs never happened before in my life. I‚Äôm finding I‚Äôm not hungry often. Eating makes me feel sick. I‚Äôve started losing weight cuz of the stress, and for a skinny dude, that‚Äôs a little out of the ordinary. I‚Äôm also breaking out in itchy sores on my hands, and I‚Äôm tired constantly. My wife says that recently I just seem sad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want to be this way, and when I really think about it, there‚Äôs nothing bad about either of the things going on. They‚Äôre both good, but I still feel the way I do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me understands that a lot of it is due to everything being so new and unknown. Given some time, I‚Äôll grow accustomed to it all and feel better. But for the time being, I would love to know how you all have dealt with anxiety and whatnot during tough or stressful times. Thank you all so much in advance for taking time to read this and comment.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôd like to explore some concepts around depression and depressive feelings, because the word ‚Äúdepression‚Äù is so over used these days to define a huge range of differing conditions, from mild melancholy, to extreme bi-polar depression.

So, for the context of this blog entry, I‚Äôd like to focus on ‚Äúgeneralised depression.‚Äù Like when you feel a bit down or ‚Äòout of salts‚Äô or when life has become a little challenging and is not going your way, perhaps we could label it as mildly depressed, rather than, suffering from a mental health disorder (*personally I don‚Äôt like the term ‚Äòmental health disorder‚Äô for generalised depression because it assumes you have no say in the matter, and I think you do*.)

In my experience just using the word depression makes some people feel uncomfortable, because, the other person either knows (through experience) how you feel, or they may have empathy, but no real understanding.

## So what is mild depression?

Personally, I think general depression is the bodies way of telling you that things are not OK within your emotional body (self) due to the effects of your life, relationships, thoughts and the environment you may find yourself in, some of which you can control and much you can‚Äôt. By numbing your emotions (unconsciously) your fatigued body is trying to keep you safe by:

* Withdrawing¬† you from conflict
* Making you feel down, so you may be more likely to change your‚Ä¶ (job, partner, situation etc.)
* It makes decision making harder (to stop you making rash decisions)
* It tries to make you seek support or help
* By feeling numb you can ‚Äòput up with‚Äô things that you can‚Äôt change
* Bad feelings try to pull you away from that which is not good for you

So, if depressive feelings are a natural bodily response to things that are not good for you (much like happiness is a natural bodily response to things that are good for you) then, we really need to listen to our emotions and act upon them!

## How do you respond to depressive feelings?

So, here is the crux of my hypothesis ‚Äì **How do you respond to depressive feelings?** Because depending on your personality type, your education, your parental influences, your health etc. you may interpret depression in many differing ways:

* Do you listen to the emotions and change that in your life which is causing disruption?
* Do you move (unknowingly) to a victim stance and say *‚ÄúWell, what can I do, I have depression.‚Äù*
* Are you lucky enough to never get overwhelmed? (Lucky, or are you missing something?)
* Do you start blaming people / events and look to others to change so your life will be better?
* Do you try to control your life to keep bad things away (that strategy is actually called [**anxiety**]
* Do you dwell on the past and rerun horrible stories around in your mind?

Of course, we knowingly (and unknowingly) have many ways that we could respond, however, once depression gets a hold, it is often hard to get enough [**motivation** ](https://calmnessinmind.com/help-for-anxiety-ocd-gad-depression/feeling-stuck-or-lost)to actually do something. Therefore, what I would like you to consider is‚Ä¶.

Even though I feel depressed, have no energy, can‚Äôt concentrate, lack motivation, hate myself, blame others, feel crap etc. etc. Is this just natures way of saying ***‚Äúthings are not right‚Äù*** and you need to explore (not only) what is happening out there, but also, what is happening within you! Your attitudes, your desires, your relationships, your work, your emotional needs, your physical needs, your dietary needs. Because nobody is going to change your emotions except yourself. Anti-depressants may lift you temporarily, however, what then? If nothing else changes in your life.

Early stage depression is a natural emotional guidance system, we need to listen to what our body is telling us and remove from our life that which is causing pain ‚Äì and if that is not possible, we need to learn differing coping strategies that are loving to ourselves and conducive to our emotional stability.

Happiness moves us towards things that are good for us and depression moves us away from things that are bad for us ‚Äì perhaps you can explore in your mind, the concept that depression is OK, it is natural, and you just need to learn how to work with it.

## Could melancholy emotions &amp; depression actually inspire us?

Have you ever thought about why so many great people experienced depression? Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Stephen Fry, Abraham Lincoln, Woody Allen, Buzz Aldrin, Agatha Christie, Bob Dylan, Tony Hancock, Vincent Van Gogh, Leo Tolstoy‚Ä¶. the list goes on and on.

All hugely talented people, inspirational and creative. Perhaps, by embracing your depressive emotions and delving deep inside yourself ‚Äì exploring who you are and what you want ‚Äì you may find the real you and the strength to face life (and live life) in new and profoundly more courageous ways. I think that to live life without emotions (good, as well as bad) is to live life without passion.

Perhaps depression could become a blessing [**if you knew what to do with it?**]","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.johnglanvill.com/depression-natural-us/""&gt;Could depression be natural for us?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

I feel guilty, stupid and sad. And yes, I understand that it sounds like a co-dependent relationship, maybe it is, but when I fall in love with someone, I dive in it, give it all, 100%.  It just can't be otherwise with me.

But how to stop overthinking, worrying about the little things?  How not to pay attention to every detail, single action?  How to be more confident in yourself, trust your partner?

I&amp;#39;ve seen a therapist a few times over the past couple years (for relationship help) but I haven&amp;#39;t seen her since Nov 2018. He told me I need to be on anti-anxiety medication because it&amp;#39;s ruining my life and I am not living. He then said if I was on anti-anxiety medication, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be calling him at midnight asking for help. I then shifted the conversation back to my concern about my head, asking for help. He told me to take an over the counter medication. I&amp;#39;ve never experienced this type of lecturing and such a condescending tone from a doctor ever. This was my first time ever talking with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel horrible, I&amp;#39;m crying, and my head still hurts. If I could just make my anxiety stop, I would. He made me feel really ashamed to even have anxiety in my life. I honestly just needed to vent. This is my first time posting on this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure my PE is linked to my anxiety and self-esteem issues but it also feels like a very medical, physiological issue. I&amp;#39;m on the fence about whether to talk to a psychologist or a just a regular doctor about this. What would you recommend? Has anyone here who has experienced PE managed to overcome it? No pun intended I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks people&lt;/p&gt;

These last few days have been hell for me.

A few days ago I felt a bony lump on the top of my head, slightly to the left.¬† Honestly, I kind of remember it being there for quite a long time but I can't know for sure.¬† For some reason, my mind instantly went to it being a tumour.¬† I then went to Google to do some research as I always do when I find something I don't know about, big mistake as it turns out.¬† I found some websites which had the symptoms listed out and I was horrified to realise that I matched some of the descriptions.

According to Google, the hard, immovable lump on my head could be skin cancer.¬† It just all went downhill from there, I started looking up symptoms of other kinds of cancer.¬† I had always thought that my left rib stuck out more than my right because of bad posture, now i'm convinced that it is because my spleen is enlarged from lymphoma.¬† I used to think that the red dots on my upper arms were just from puberty and eating junk food, now i'm convinced that I have leukaemia.¬† It just goes on and on and on.¬†¬†

I had a panic attack and finally decided to tell my parents about it.¬† Both my mom and dad are telling me that it is nothing, but my mom said she can take my to a GP to get it checked out if it will help calm me down.¬† So i'm going on Tuesday.

So far i'm convinced that I have like 5 different cancers.¬† But I also know that if I really did had 5 cancers, i'd probably be long dead, and the odds of an 18 year old guy getting cancer are pretty slim.¬† But my dad's nasal and sinus cancer wasn't discovered until it was stage 3, and he doesn't even smoke or drink (much).¬† I've also been told that i'm at a higher risk of developing cancer since my dad had it.

Today, I woke up with a mild fever that comes and goes, and most worryingly at the moment, a weird aching in the base of skull.¬† I went on another ill-advised trip down the Google rabbit hole and have now convinced myself that I have meningitis, which kills you even fast than cancer as it turns out.  I might not even make it to my appointment if it really is meningitis.

During my journey on Google, I stumbled across an article about hypochondria, which is surprisingly similar to what i'm feeling right now.  I'll probably ask the GP about it, but some extra advice from you guys can't hurt. Could my fever come from just stress and anxiety?  Because strangely, it seems to get worse whenever i'm Googling symptoms.

I've had anxiety for a very long time and only quite recently I've been taking deliberate steps to deal with it. I'm currently reading a book called 'The Road Less Travelled' by M. Scott Peck, and so far it's been an incredible read. It doesn't sugarcoat the fact that life is difficult, and pain cannot be stopped. But it helps you change the way you perceive the struggles in life, and gives you tools in how to accept and even numb suffering, as well as make right decisions, even if they seem painful.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to give too much away, but if you haven't read it I strongly suggest it. Reading that and doing candlelight meditation is helping me through a big transition going on in my life currently. They're certainly not curing me of all my anxiety, but they're helping and that's what matters.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the current anxiety symptoms I'm dealing with right now (I've always had these but they exist in greater or lesser degree depending on what's going on in my life)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crying during confrontation- I've had this since I was a child. If I get yelled at or if someone seems mad with me, or even just confronts me with a difficult situation out of the blue, I cry. It's something I'm still trying to find a way to control. I find that my heart starts racing before it happens and my throat starts to get tight. After that, it's like trying to hold in a sneeze.

\- Shallow breathing- there are times where I'll consciously realise that I'm breathing too little, or even holding my breath. Then I start taking deep breaths in which spurrs on the anxious feelings.

\- Overthinking- I don't think I've ever stopped doing this, but it's definitely at a high right now (again, because I've got big changes coming)

\- Second guessing myself- Whenever I've gotten into an argument or butted heads with anyone, I usually automatically assume that they're right and I'm wrong, even if I know I'm right. Does that make sense...? I usually think 'what if they're right though, they're probably smarter than me, I should just make up with them, I'm probably wrong anyway' etc....

\- Fear of failure and not being good enough- I feel like this one speaks for itself pretty well.

\- Fear of the future- incessant worrying that something bad will happen to me or someone I love. Mostly to the person who is going through this life change with me.

&amp;#x200B;

There are others but these are the ones that stick most with me right now. Candlelight meditation and reading are helping, and despite these symptoms, things in my life are on the up. I try to focus on that as much as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any other suggestions? How do you meditate? How do you cope with symptoms like these?

Thank you","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend it to anybody that has had trouble with meditation in the past.. I&amp;#39;ve tried other forms of meditation and found it really hard to quiet my mind for more than a few seconds. Staring at the candlelight really helps keep me in the present, and just watch the flame dance. I also like to let empowering words come to my mind as I watch the flame, such as &amp;#39;patience&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;power&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;strength&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; etc...&lt;/p&gt;

I cooked and cleaned for him, helped him do his schoolwork, bought him groceries, gave him a place to stay, etc. I was his mom and maid. I found out right before he was supposed to move in with me, from texts on his phone, that he cheated on me with his intern.

The other girl was obsessive, a nonissue, a nothing, not even worth it. 

I eventually found out he had been lying the whole time and was basically juggling us at the same time to figure out who he wanted more. He was mentally and emotionally abusive.

Alone is all I can ever see, with support as plenty as the amount of red maple leaves on a dead cedar tree. Fragile bark fails a squat with over 400 pounds on my chest, I need a rest but all I do is treat life as a test. I work hard to stretch, but the runner left as fast as she knew it was best.

Cut scene, the play ended and I dropped the prop, and fell face foward, falling to the start. Time moves slowly and every move feels like I lose. Still pushing through the week, for the support for the team seems most week during August action. Reactions seems so drastic, even my poetry has taken a tole, like gold that was actually plastic.

It‚Äôs hard to know where to begin. I‚Äôm going to struggle to type this out and make it understandable. It seems like people don‚Äôt often connect with the way I naturally communicate things about myself. And it‚Äôs hard for me to describe. I‚Äôll do my best. 

After much struggle and personal growth, I managed to finally decide on what I really want to do with my life in my mid-thirties. I‚Äôm in that career now and in my late thirties. I love my job. It gives meaning to my life, and while I‚Äôm doing it, I feel very fulfilled. 

I‚Äôm self-employed and make my own schedule, a long-time dream of mine after enduring the usual workplace bullshit at a variety of jobs, mostly office and restaurant work. This has allowed me to make a three day work week that pays my bills and allows me to slowly pay down debt. I have four consecutive days off every week. The idea was to do things I enjoy, things that sustain me, and focus on further personal growth on those long weekends. 

The reality has been different. To explain the hell I‚Äôm trapped in, I‚Äôll describe how it was made, and where I find myself now.

One of my earliest memories is from preschool. I think I was 4 years old at the time. I refused to make a bear out of construction paper with my class. The teacher said that if I was not going to do it, I couldn‚Äôt play with anything in the room. I walked around and looked at things. I picked up a plastic soup can. The teacher told me I had to put it down because I was not allowed to play. That‚Äôs all I remember. This memory haunts me, and I think of it regularly. I believe that I wouldn‚Äôt work on that bear for the same reason I have difficulty getting started on and completing many tasks. I‚Äôm deeply anxious about doing anything, because I fear punishment if I make some mistake I can‚Äôt necessarily predict. 

Growing up, my angry, red-faced father would often find fault in my actions. He hit me, spanked me, yanked me around by the arm until my parents divorced when I was 7. In another memory, very young, I dropped a glass soda bottle on the hard, utility room floor. It broke. I started crying hysterically and ran in terror into my moms lap. She didn‚Äôt seem to understand why I was so upset. On a different day, that could have sent my dad into a rage. Anyway, my dad programmed me to understand that any action could end in disaster, and I could not predict which action would take me there. 

I know that simple actions will not likely result in disaster now, but the wounded, anxious part of myself is still terrified. I‚Äôm very good at shoving it under the surface and performing when I absolutely must, like at work. It takes a certain toll on me, but I am accustomed to it. In fact, I wasn‚Äôt aware I was dealing with anxiety at all until my early twenties. It got shoved under the surface and manifested as procrastination and depression. I couldn‚Äôt see what was happening in me for what it was. I developed self-soothing, avoidant behaviors when I was young. Binge watching TV. Overeating. Video game marathons. 

When I get to my own free time, my ability to cope with the anxiety and do healthy, productive things is all over the map. At the ends of my work weeks, I find it very hard to resist buying some unhealthy food, maybe some alcohol, and escaping the pain for a time through binge watching something and eating. The feeling of just sitting at home is often the feeling of impending doom. Not only is doing things problematic, but also the feeling I might not be doing the right things at the moment is there. Like any time disaster could strike. Anyway, typically 2-3 of my 4 days off are spent in avoidant behaviors, feeling fairly miserable overall. I feel trapped. I do make the right decisions some days, but it doesn‚Äôt last. 

I‚Äôve been doing work to heal this part of myself, and it feels like there‚Äôs been progress. I alternate between reminding myself that I‚Äôm better able to comfort myself, be kind to myself, than ever before, and feeling like I‚Äôm stuck and will never fully pull out of this cycle. 

I am alone most of the time and feel very lonely. I have a few close friends, for whom I‚Äôm very thankful, but they‚Äôre all busy and drifting away. My last relationship (6 months long) ended 10 months ago. I feel unhappy with my appearance and don‚Äôt want to date again until I have my weight under better control. I have been going to the gym at least 3 times a week since January, but the overeating evens it out and there‚Äôs no progress. I generally feel I‚Äôm not good enough. I feel like my place needs to be painted and organized before I bring anyone over, but barely keep up with basic cleaning due to the fear avoidance I‚Äôve described. I try to imagine being happy with who I am now, the place I live as it is now, etc. I try to imagine dating anyway and letting the chips fall where they may. The thought of getting turned down for these imperfections scares me though, even though I really shouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt want me as I am. I don‚Äôt want to do any new social activities because I‚Äôm afraid I will meet someone I like at a time when I‚Äôm not happy with myself. 

I feel like a jerk for complaining about my life where all of my basic needs are met and I have far more leisure time available to me than the average person. But I feel truly miserable much of the time. The healthy tools I‚Äôve picked up stay in the toolbox much of the time, and it‚Äôs all the more frustrating knowing they‚Äôre there but I can‚Äôt use them. And then wondering if maybe I can, but I‚Äôm choosing not to. But I really feel like I can‚Äôt grasp them right now. So I‚Äôm writing this.

My anxiety really began to show when I turned 17, I‚Äôm 21 now and just recently began taking SSRIs to help me cope. 

Growing up my brother went through two AVMs in his brain which is a poor connection between arteries and veins. When I was 12 years old him and I were playing together in the snow, we went back inside and he collapsed. He spent two weeks in the hospital where he was on the verge of death most of the time (he was only 8) 
They had to remove part of his skull for 6 months. After he got out of the hospital and began to slightly return to normal (as normal as you can be after that) he started showing changes. He started not being able to hug my dad. He would just get really uncomfortable. Then he couldn‚Äôt touch something my dad had touched and it began to progress that way. 2 years later he went back to the doctor and they found another in his brain. They caught it before it ruptured and removed it. After he recovered things with my dad got drastically worse, and my brother was diagnosed with severe OCD.  

(My dad was and is a wonderful father, he‚Äôs never hurt us or done anything to make us uncomfortable, he‚Äôs a very patient man, and incredibly strong, the disorder just chose this)

Now 6 years later he cannot even hear my dad cough without loosing his mind and trying to harm himself. They still live together (don‚Äôt ask me how it‚Äôs a very toxic environment) and I recently moved in with my boyfriend (to get out of the environment and because my boyfriend and I were ready to live together) 

I was with my ex for over 2 years, I noticed my anxiety with him after I got more attached to him, I would constantly worry he would ever marry me (I was 18) And I would worry he didn‚Äôt really love me, I would worry he had bad intentions or was just with me just to be with me  for now but was eventually going to leave me. I would worry he just didn‚Äôt love me that much, or he just didn‚Äôt care. He had pretty bad depression too so that didn‚Äôt help me or him. We could be happy and smiling together and I would be terrified he was going to leave me. I would constantly seek reassurance from him that he did love me and would marry me one day. But as a 19 year old guy I think that thought was a bit intimidating so he would get really closed off. Some people may have not thought we were compatible because of my worry but most of my worries weren‚Äôt real worries, just anxious thoughts all the time. 
I broke it off with him because it just became too hard, and I wasn‚Äôt feeling like I was getting the love that I wanted and needed. (It was so hard for me but it hit me one day that I needed something better for me, and I had been working so hard on my anxiety and it had gotten a lot better) 
Then I began dating one of my coworkers who I had been friends with for awhile. The beginning was like a movie, it was something I had never felt. I felt free, I felt like I had met my perfect match, we fell more deeply in love, we laughed so much together, spent everyday together, we both agreed it just felt right. We moved in together, and have been living together for 6 months now (we have been together for a year and 4 months)  my anxiety returned with a vengeance. I have this perfect and wonderful man but I‚Äôm terrified of his true intentions, I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôll never commit to me, I‚Äôm scared we aren‚Äôt compatible. I have all my anxious feelings back just like I did before. 

My boyfriend (he‚Äôs 24) is a very confident man, he is very child like, and just a complete ball of energy most of the time, he makes me laugh all the time, and always keeps me entertained, when he comes home from work most of the time he screeches then gives me a huge hug, he is very mushy and expressive with me, he will just hold me and tell me he loves me and tells me how cute I am to him. Stuff I‚Äôve always wanted. We both love spending time together, we are best friends and always have an incredible time together, sometimes we spend hours dancing around our house together. 
He‚Äôs very career oriented man. He works a lot and very hard too. Finances are important to him, he didn‚Äôt have much growing up, so now he wants to be very very stable. We have gone though some pretty tough times lately... our HVAC unit broke and he had to pay 2500 to get it fixed, our house needs a roof and siding which will be 40000...  after hearing all this news he‚Äôs been different. We used to talk about the home we would have in the future, we used to talk about having kids and now he‚Äôs saying he doesn‚Äôt know if he wants kids. And he‚Äôs not talking about the future so much anymore, and my anxiety is at an all time high. I‚Äôm not even sure if I want children or not but I‚Äôm just so anxious about us now, I go to sleep and wake up anxious, but if I tell him my anxieties right now he doesn‚Äôt react like he used too... I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs taking a pretty big hit right now or worried about his future, or because of me... we got into a bad fight a few weeks ago. He came out to me as bisexual and that made my anxiety got bonkers... (I was terrified he would leave me for a man one day or that I would never be enough or I wasn‚Äôt what he wanted, I felt kind of lied to) ((I have no judgement of any sexual identity either, i 100% support the LGBTQ community, it‚Äôs just my anxiety issue)) 
I was so panicked and he was going through struggles with the house I felt I he wasn‚Äôt in a place to talk about it at that time but I was dying for reassurance. So I talked to one of my very close friends about it and he got furious. He was so angry and felt like I had betrayed him. I know I was wrong. I acted out of fear but I was so scared. Now my anxiety torments me everyday. Where as before I could manage it, now I‚Äôm struggling to go to work some days.  I love this man, he‚Äôs been my best friend for awhile now and I can really picture myself having an incredibly happy life with him. But I‚Äôm filled with fear from morning till night now, I‚Äôm worried he doesn‚Äôt want kids and he‚Äôll never change his mind back (he has been sort of on the fence throughout our relationship but has usually come back to wanting kids) I‚Äôm just wondering if his change in behavior Is because he‚Äôs going through a really tough time with work and finances which stress him. And he‚Äôs just thinking children are very expensive and he doesn‚Äôt want that? I‚Äôm spiraling. I can‚Äôt stop being consumed with things to figure out the future and saving our future and trying to figure out what is really going on. I‚Äôm exhausted and just terrified to loose him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was recently diagnosed with GAD and depression.

But I‚Äôm filled with fear from morning till night now, I‚Äôm worried he doesn‚Äôt want kids and he‚Äôll never change his mind back (he has been sort of on the fence throughout our relationship but has usually come back to wanting kids) I‚Äôm just wondering if his change in behavior Is because he‚Äôs going through a really tough time with work and finances which stress him. And he‚Äôs just thinking children are very expensive and he doesn‚Äôt want that? I‚Äôm spiraling. I can‚Äôt stop being consumed with things to figure out the future and saving our future and trying to figure out what is really going on. I‚Äôm exhausted and just terrified to loose him.&lt;/p&gt;

Feeling the palpitations and having the waves of anxiety is making me worried about having a heart issue. It‚Äòs always on my mind and hard to stop thinking about it. 2 years ago I did have some anxiety attacks (didn‚Äôt know what they were at the time), but after a couple of incidences of anxiety then, I was fine up until recently. I went to my doctor, and he said it‚Äôs probably anxiety, but just in case I should see a cardiologist. The next day, I had another wave of anxiety for 30 minutes and then it escalated and I had a massive panic attack (it‚Äôs really the worst feeling ever). I went to the ER and they said after doing blood work and an EKG that I was totally fine and just had a panic attack. All weekend I was having severe anxiety symptoms where I couldn‚Äôt move off of the couch (hot/cold flashes, palpitations, anxiousness, muscle twitches, etc.). I went back to the doctor and he said all of my blood work was fine and it‚Äôs most likely just anxiety and let‚Äôs see what the cardiologist says (gave me some klonopin which definitely helped calm my nerves). I‚Äôve had some random anxiety attacks since (usually after feeling the palpitations) but nothing as bad as the panic attack. I‚Äòm assuming I‚Äôm just experiencing anticipatory anxiety about having another panic attack and also health anxiety every time I feel the palpitations (I always have overanalyzed and worried about things). 

So fast forward to today - I started seeing a therapist, had multiple EKGs, stress test, echo, and holter monitor. Haven‚Äôt had the results yet from the heart tests (except my EKGs looked fine according to multiple doctors), but I‚Äôm going to find out more this week. I have a feeling (and really hope) it‚Äôs all anxiety, but I have some questions for everyone so I can help understand what‚Äôs going on and if this truly is all normal with anxiety.

* From other people‚Äòs experiences, does this sound like normal anxiety and panic and do you experience similar symptoms?
* Has anyone ever had palpitations that happen randomly (or when their heart rate goes up or when they go for a walk or run)? Mine seem to happen quite often when I go for a longer walk and my heart rate elevates. Doesn‚Äòt happen all of the time but it seems pretty common now. I want to run again but I‚Äôm afraid i‚Äôm going to have palpitations or a heart issue.
* Does anyone feel normal and get a somatic symptom (like heart palpitations) and then get a rush of anxiety / panic and then constantly worry about it or do you only get these symptoms when you‚Äôre thinking of something which then triggers the anxiety?
* How do you usually cope when you feel the palpitations (or other symptoms) happen?

**this is the story way back and til now**

This is the love of my life I'm talking about, she has depression years ago even before we got together, she tried using pills after her psychologist prescribed it but the pill was just getting in her way and it was too expensive for her *(they are a little below middle class and her family has debts which she and her sister have to pay)*. She also said the pill was counterproductive since she can't finish her work anymore because she always feels like a high zombie. She stopped using the pills and everything was kinda going okay because she moved in with her aunt's house. *(also the first main cause of her depression was her mom)*. She got enrolled in culinary school which her aunt sponsored her and she was happy for a while, but then again her depression came back because of how her aunt is very strict, she is already an adult but she has still no freedom, but when it comes to her male cousins they had all the freedom they wanted which made her depressed that she can't go out and be with me most of the time.

**\*\*NOTE**

**Her Aunt pays for her tuition at the culinary school she goes to. she is like the breadwinner of their clan, that's why she can't just openly rebel to someone who just helped her make her dreams come true. but at an emotional price**

Sometimes she breaks down at her aunt's place at night and just cries because of the no freedom thing and more. The first time she wanted to kill herself there, *(it was the dead hour, maybe around 12md-3am )* I suggested going to her and keeping her company even if I was just outside their gate, in the end, we decided to sneak out and sleep in my place and she would just make an excuse that she left early for school which sometimes she really does.

It kept going and going, we only usually do the sneaking out part when her aunt is traveling but now we are doing it on almost a daily basis. but even though I did this to keep her company, now she is regretting it because she still can't be free from them. She is tired of all the lying and the excuses, she just wants to tell the truth. so she won't feel guilty all the time. and now today,

Today June 15, 2019, we had an awesome and wonderful day. there was a party at her school and I went there with her because of free food *(since it is a culinary school)* everything went great until when we got home to my place. we were just happily talking about things and when it was time to sleep she just felt empty again. she wanted to kill herself again, she did not feel this for a long time or so I thought, she said she feels this every day but she just tries to make it work, right now she said she really wants to do what she always wanted to do. to kill herself, she said she wanted to get out of my house and just walk aimlessly and find a spot where she can kill herself. Of Course, knowing that I stopped her and we had this argument about how I want her to live *(we had so much plan in the future and we are planning to get married next year)* and now she just feels so empty and she really wants to die, no matter what I tell her she just tells me it's just what I want and what she wants is to die. Then she said we are DONE. That we are breaking up and that I am too good for her and she is just so toxic in our relationship. She keeps on saying I deserve better BUT HERE'S THE THING GUYS. SHE IS ALREADY BETTER, SHE KNOWS THAT SHE IS BETTER AND I TOLD HER LOTS OF TIMES THAT I HAD A CRUSH ON HER WAAAAY BEFORE WE GOT TOGETHER. SHE IS SUPER NICE, SUPER SMART, KIND HEARTED AND IS VERY VERY LOVABLE. JUST BECAUSE SHIT HAPPENED IN HER LIFE SHE IS DEPRESSED AND WANTS TO KILL HERSELF BUT SHE JUST DOESN'T SHOW IT. NOW....Now she wants to break up.

**\*\*NOTE**

**We had an argument like this a couple of months ago but not to this extreme. she said we are done after her episode but in the end, we got along again, and she told me and promised me to now believe her when she says we are done and that we are going to break up.**

Again, she wants to break up now and she keeps on pushing me away, telling me hurtful things. *(She doesn't hurt me physically)* and until now she still feels that way. Right now she went back to her aunt's place, I'm afraid she's gonna do something bad, but she promised me that she won't.She still wants to break up with me though, I mean we are already broken up. She said it is the only way for me to not get hurt when she kills herself, BUT OF COURSE, I'LL GET HURT.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANY MORE GUYS. IM PANICKING RIGHT NOW AND I'VE BEEN CRYING SINCE SHE LEFT.

I TOLD HER COUSIN WHO SHE WAS CLOSE WITH AND IS LIVING TOGETHER WITH HER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BUT SHE MIGHT STILL BE ASLEEP BECAUSE ITS STILL 3:30AM HERE.

SHE JUST GRADUATED FROM HER CULINARY SCHOOL, A SCHOOL THAT SHE REALLY ADMIRED AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY, SHE IS NOW ONE OF THE TOP CHEF IN HER BATCH THAT IS COMPETING IN A TOURNAMENT A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW THIS ALSO MADE HER HAPPY *(but maybe the stress and pressure is getting into her)* . NOW SHE JUST WANTS TO KILL HERSELF. AND I CAN'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT. WHAT DO I DO, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THESE.

I AM THE STUPID ONE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HER. I TELL HER HOW I FEEL AND I EVEN GOOGLED HOW TO DEAL WITH DEPRESSION IN THE PAST, BUT NOW SHE SAYS SHE JUST WANTS TO KILL HERSELF. I AM LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WHEN I TALK TO HER, EVERYTHING IS GOING IN CIRCLES.

AND NOW SHE LEFT ME AND IS GONNA KILL HERSELF TT\^TT

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUQ

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

She is now okay guys! most of you helped a lot!

we talked for a bit before she went to work and we visited her grandfather because it was his death anniv.

I joined her at work so she wouldn't get lonely *(because every Sunday she is the only one working and it really gets lonely at her office).* 

We didn't go to any police or hospital because in the place we live in or ""Depression"" isn't really real here, it's not treated as seriously as it should be. And Immediate Therapy won't work either, we have no money for that, she is in debt, her family is in debt and her aunt has already had too much to pay and she would just feel depressed if she is gonna ask her aunt for more money. So those were out of the options, instead, I talked to her and we got back together, after how I broke down in front of her and when she said she really didn't want to leave me, she just wanted to push me away so she could try to remember herself and so that I won't miss her when she kills herself .

also talking to her aunt and most of her family right now isn't going to cut it. She already tried to talk to them in the past and it didn't work so that's why she doesn't want to ask them for help anymore because they just can't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to tell her that I will help her through everything and she shouldn't feel sorry or shy to get help from me.

I don't have a high paying job but I promised her in the future after I also paid my debts that I will pay for her therapy, which she declined because it is my money but after I while she agreed because I kept on telling her its not a problem for me because that therapy is for us and our future etc. because we are gonna get married again. (Yeeeet)

&amp;#x200B;

I and some of her cousin will try and talk to her from time to time to help her get out of whatever hole she's in because she says she really feel that she's at an all-time low and that she's really in deep. (this is until we really get her professional help of course or even after.)

&amp;#x200B;

Ooof... this morning everything was going fine then her mom chatted her that she isn't bringing enough money for their debts which made her feel things again. luckily I was with her, now I am also helping her get rid of her families debts.

which is very fine by me. I want to invest everything that I can to make her happy because again I am going to be her husband and the future so making her happy and safe will also make me feel that.

(she is not forcing me to pay her debt's nor she agreed that I help her pay her debts even a little because I have my own debts, but I still want to do it anyway.i'll just do whatever I can for now)

hopefully, everything will be fine.

Thank you, everyone!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time writing this, and I really need help and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today June 15, 2019, we had an awesome and wonderful day. there was a party at her school and I went there with her because of free food &lt;em&gt;(since it is a culinary school)&lt;/em&gt; everything went great until when we got home to my place. we were just happily talking about things and when it was time to sleep she just felt empty again. she wanted to kill herself again, she did not feel this for a long time or so I thought, she said she feels this every day but she just tries to make it work, right now she said she really wants to do what she always wanted to do. to kill herself, she said she wanted to get out of my house and just walk aimlessly and find a spot where she can kill herself. Of Course, knowing that I stopped her and we had this argument about how I want her to live &lt;em&gt;(we had so much plan in the future and we are planning to get married next year)&lt;/em&gt; and now she just feels so empty and she really wants to die, no matter what I tell her she just tells me it&amp;#39;s just what I want and what she wants is to die. Then she said we are DONE. That we are breaking up and that I am too good for her and she is just so toxic in our relationship. She keeps on saying I deserve better BUT HERE&amp;#39;S THE THING GUYS. SHE IS ALREADY BETTER, SHE KNOWS THAT SHE IS BETTER AND I TOLD HER LOTS OF TIMES THAT I HAD A CRUSH ON HER WAAAAY BEFORE WE GOT TOGETHER. SHE IS SUPER NICE, SUPER SMART, KIND HEARTED AND IS VERY VERY LOVABLE. JUST BECAUSE SHIT HAPPENED IN HER LIFE SHE IS DEPRESSED AND WANTS TO KILL HERSELF BUT SHE JUST DOESN&amp;#39;T SHOW IT. NOW....Now she wants to break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We had an argument like this a couple of months ago but not to this extreme. she said we are done after her episode but in the end, we got along again, and she told me and promised me to now believe her when she says we are done and that we are going to break up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, she wants to break up now and she keeps on pushing me away, telling me hurtful things. &lt;em&gt;(She doesn&amp;#39;t hurt me physically)&lt;/em&gt; and until now she still feels that way. Right now she went back to her aunt&amp;#39;s place, I&amp;#39;m afraid she&amp;#39;s gonna do something bad, but she promised me that she won&amp;#39;t.She still wants to break up with me though, I mean we are already broken up. She said it is the only way for me to not get hurt when she kills herself, BUT OF COURSE, I&amp;#39;LL GET HURT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANY MORE GUYS. IM PANICKING RIGHT NOW AND I&amp;#39;VE BEEN CRYING SINCE SHE LEFT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I TOLD HER COUSIN WHO SHE WAS CLOSE WITH AND IS LIVING TOGETHER WITH HER ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BUT SHE MIGHT STILL BE ASLEEP BECAUSE ITS STILL 3:30AM HERE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE JUST GRADUATED FROM HER CULINARY SCHOOL, A SCHOOL THAT SHE REALLY ADMIRED AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY, SHE IS NOW ONE OF THE TOP CHEF IN HER BATCH THAT IS COMPETING IN A TOURNAMENT A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW THIS ALSO MADE HER HAPPY &lt;em&gt;(but maybe the stress and pressure is getting into her)&lt;/em&gt; . NOW SHE JUST WANTS TO KILL HERSELF. AND I CAN&amp;#39;T DO SHIT ABOUT IT. WHAT DO I DO, I CAN&amp;#39;T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THESE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM THE STUPID ONE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP SO I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HER. I TELL HER HOW I FEEL AND I EVEN GOOGLED HOW TO DEAL WITH DEPRESSION IN THE PAST, BUT NOW SHE SAYS SHE JUST WANTS TO KILL HERSELF. I AM LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WHEN I TALK TO HER, EVERYTHING IS GOING IN CIRCLES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND NOW SHE LEFT ME AND IS GONNA KILL HERSELF TT^TT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***UPDATE**\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is now okay guys! most of you helped a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we talked for a bit before she went to work and we visited her grandfather because it was his death anniv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined her at work so she wouldn&amp;#39;t get lonely &lt;em&gt;(because every Sunday she is the only one working and it really gets lonely at her office).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t go to any police or hospital because in the place we live in or &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t really real here, it&amp;#39;s not treated as seriously as it should be. And Immediate Therapy won&amp;#39;t work either, we have no money for that, she is in debt, her family is in debt and her aunt has already had too much to pay and she would just feel depressed if she is gonna ask her aunt for more money. So those were out of the options, instead, I talked to her and we got back together, after how I broke down in front of her and when she said she really didn&amp;#39;t want to leave me, she just wanted to push me away so she could try to remember herself and so that I won&amp;#39;t miss her when she kills herself .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also talking to her aunt and most of her family right now isn&amp;#39;t going to cut it. She already tried to talk to them in the past and it didn&amp;#39;t work so that&amp;#39;s why she doesn&amp;#39;t want to ask them for help anymore because they just can&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to tell her that I will help her through everything and she shouldn&amp;#39;t feel sorry or shy to get help from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a high paying job but I promised her in the future after I also paid my debts that I will pay for her therapy, which she declined because it is my money but after I while she agreed because I kept on telling her its not a problem for me because that therapy is for us and our future etc. because we are gonna get married again. (Yeeeet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I and some of her cousin will try and talk to her from time to time to help her get out of whatever hole she&amp;#39;s in because she says she really feel that she&amp;#39;s at an all-time low and that she&amp;#39;s really in deep. (this is until we really get her professional help of course or even after.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooof... this morning everything was going fine then her mom chatted her that she isn&amp;#39;t bringing enough money for their debts which made her feel things again. luckily I was with her, now I am also helping her get rid of her families debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which is very fine by me. I want to invest everything that I can to make her happy because again I am going to be her husband and the future so making her happy and safe will also make me feel that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(she is not forcing me to pay her debt&amp;#39;s nor she agreed that I help her pay her debts even a little because I have my own debts, but I still want to do it anyway.i&amp;#39;ll just do whatever I can for now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hopefully, everything will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

I love animals.  I have for my entire life.  I've always felt a strong connection with them, and people have always noticed it.  When I was a child, I was painfully shy, and they brought me out of my shell.  As an adult, I work at a veterinary hospital as a kennel technician and dog trainer.  The kennel tech job is considered to be the most physically intense and stressful job due to all of the things we have to do.  Everyone else works within their specific titles, but we've got crossover in every direction, from cleaning and helping with surgeries to walking dogs, medicating pets, grooming stuff, feedings, checking pets in and discharging them, etc.  But because I'm with animals all day, I can honestly say I am not at all stressed by it.  I see it as a delightful challenge.  We have the least interaction with owners of any employees there.  A little more poop for a little less shit?  That's good with me!

Anyway, we've been wanting another dog for nearly three years and planning for another one for about eight months.  We adopted our first dog about five years ago.  His life was at stake, so I took him in.  He's very well-trained and a great dog, but, like people, they have a range of personalities.  Me?  I'm not really a touchy-feely kind of person except with animals.  Him?  He tolerates touch.  He loves to play, go on walks and hikes, and work on training drills, but anything longer than a 10 second pet and he gets visibly pissed.  He came from a gay couple that was going to put him down because they didn't have time for him, and they often had males over, so that seems to be a contributor.  He's much more easygoing with my fiance, but he still only accepts limited hands-on time.

A month ago we realized we're finally at a point where adopting our second dog could happen.  I started getting everything ready.  About two weeks ago, I started checking at shelters in within a 2 mile one-way radius of us.  On my day off on Tuesday, I went to a shelter over an hour away that had about a dozen dogs we were interested in.  The first dog I saw on their website for adoption was the last one I saw on my self-guided tour.  I loved his picture and description, but I was hesitant to go for him like my gut told me to because he's heartworm positive (however, almost finished with treatment).

Guys...  The way he looked at me...  Wow.  Wow...  I sat in front of his kennel.  Since I hear much louder dogs all day for 13 hours at work, it didn't bother me.  I sat there and spoke to him, and really loved his reactions.  He was friendly and extremely calm to be barely 2 years old.  He tilted his head, perked up his ears, then laid in front of the kennel with one paw on the bars.  A shelter worker saw me smiling at him and talking to him, and she said, ""If you want to go meet him in a yard, just let us know!  He's been here for a year.  I'm sure he'd love it!""  WHELP.

Then she said, ""Oh, and you see that pink card?  All of his adoption fees are waived since he's been here so long.  He's been here longer than any dog we've ever had.""  I literally said, ""OH GOD, don't tell me that...  He's the first one that stood out to me online!""  She then told me about his heartworms and treatment, saying that all he has left are the two injections and overnight stays at the veterinarian, which their donations fund for dogs adopted with heartworms would cover too.  So I said, ""Alright.  Let's take him out.""

I knew immediately.  The smile, the calm energy.  The appreciation.  And he's quite handsome, I must say!  I ended up taking him straight home from there.  He was pre-approved by my fiance, so he re-confirmed that we were good to go!

When we got home, it went beautifully.  I invited him up on the bed with me, and he has not stopped smiling or snuggling with me yet.  The cuddles really help keep me relaxed, and it's so heart warming to finally have a dog that will lounge around with/on me, come to me first, and treat me as more than a means to an end.  It was really rough working with dogs for all of these years that loved me and coming home to a dog who acted like I was an inconvenience or irritation constantly, especially since I'd sacrificed a lot to keep him healthy and comfortable.  But now he has his Dad, and the new boy has his Mom.  It's a good balance, and my heart feels full.

And one last thing...  Boomhauer, the new boy, is a large white pit bull with black speckles and a black ear and nose.  He's sweeter than high fructose corn syrup, but you know how people stereotype pits.  I am alone several nights a month and my fiance usually takes the old dog with him because he has pup friends he plays with on those trips.  I'd get really anxious being alone at night, and I'd often drink to cope with the anxiety.  Tonight is another night where they're gone, but Boom is here with me and I've had two and a half beers in ten hours.  I feel like I'm going to sleep great while ""alone"" finally, and I don't want to get drunk because I'd much rather spend time with him.  That means no rebound anxiety in the morning from the hangover and probably-inevitable blackout.

I was at a super high dosage of escitalopram for anxiety for a couple years and was feeling extremely numb. As I started to taper off to combat the numbness, I thought, ""I can do this, I can live without meds!"" So I gradually tapered completely off them. 

Wrong. I started a new job (summer internship) and my anxiety is at its worst. I can't even go into work. I wake up shaking in fear, nauseated, completely unable to eat. I am officially not functional again. This has been going on for weeks. I've resumed medication but it's gonna be a while before it works.

My supervisor knows it's anxiety. We're having a video call on Monday to discuss if I want to continue with the internship considering my health.

I haven't been able to eat properly in over a week. I am so sick of feeling sick. I am so tempted to leave this internship to prioritize my health, but I would be so disappointed in myself and my parents would be super pissed. My dad especially doesn't really understand mental illness.

I don't know what to do and I'm absolutely dreading this.

I'm not suicidal but when I'm suffering, I don't want to be conscious.

Between taking more than a full-time course load and having a job for the first time, my life was busy between September 2018 and May 2019. During these months I never really expressed any anxiety and I managed the load just fine.  

After finishing the school year in May, I was looking forward to some relaxation during the summer as I continue to work my low stress part-time job. This was not the case. I started experiencing some lightheadedness and tremors in June. Doctor said it could've been low blood sugar from not eating in the morning but I'm starting to believe it's anxiety instead.  

These symptoms (accompanied by occasional bowel upset) seem to come and go throughout the day, where it tends to be worse during the afternoon and during the morning when I first wake up. The one moment where it seems to consistently be better is when I do cardio exercise.  

What's interesting is that I'm not actively thinking about something anxiety-provoking 100% of the time and it seems as if my symptoms come on subconsciously. However, I will have a very important decision to make in ~two weeks where I will be choosing which college I want to transfer to for the final two years of my undergrad. I feel like this could be a cause as to why I'm experiencing these symptoms, even though I'm not actively thinking about this decision.  

I also believe that there is a possibility that all this anxiety has built up throughout the 2018-2019 school year and I'm just now paying the price for being so busy and not relaxing as much as I should have, now that my lifestyle has changed from busy mode to not-busy mode. (I don't know if this is actually a thing that's why I want to see what you guys/gals think)  

Another thing I tend to do is compulsively browse the internet, if that may bring on symptoms as well.  

---  

Because of my potential anxiety issues I've just recently started to take more steps towards a more relaxed lifestyle (e.g. watching some tv instead of playing Counter Strike where my symptoms feel more exaggerated). I feel that this has helped slightly as my symptoms have lessened since last week but I was hoping for more of an impact. Perhaps this relaxation is something that I need to cultivate over time? Or is there something else I should be trying?  

---  

Anyways, I just wanted to post what I've been experiencing in hopes of receiving your thoughts/responses so I can make better sense of my situation, and if this is indeed, anxiety. This is something that I'm not used to experiencing and so I need some sort of mental framework to move forward in my life.

&lt;p&gt;These symptoms (accompanied by occasional bowel upset) seem to come and go throughout the day, where it tends to be worse during the afternoon and during the morning when I first wake up. The one moment where it seems to consistently be better is when I do cardio exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s interesting is that I&amp;#39;m not actively thinking about something anxiety-provoking 100% of the time and it seems as if my symptoms come on subconsciously. However, I will have a very important decision to make in ~two weeks where I will be choosing which college I want to transfer to for the final two years of my undergrad. I feel like this could be a cause as to why I&amp;#39;m experiencing these symptoms, even though I&amp;#39;m not actively thinking about this decision.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that there is a possibility that all this anxiety has built up throughout the 2018-2019 school year and I&amp;#39;m just now paying the price for being so busy and not relaxing as much as I should have, now that my lifestyle has changed from busy mode to not-busy mode. (I don&amp;#39;t know if this is actually a thing that&amp;#39;s why I want to see what you guys/gals think)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I tend to do is compulsively browse the internet, if that may bring on symptoms as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my potential anxiety issues I&amp;#39;ve just recently started to take more steps towards a more relaxed lifestyle (e.g. watching some tv instead of playing Counter Strike where my symptoms feel more exaggerated). I feel that this has helped slightly as my symptoms have lessened since last week but I was hoping for more of an impact. Perhaps this relaxation is something that I need to cultivate over time? Or is there something else I should be trying?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just wanted to post what I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing in hopes of receiving your thoughts/responses so I can make better sense of my situation, and if this is indeed, anxiety. This is something that I&amp;#39;m not used to experiencing and so I need some sort of mental framework to move forward in my life. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to learn from you.&lt;/p&gt;

      I‚Äôm 17 (f) and have been going through health anxiety for the past couple of months now. But, the past few weeks have been the worst. I think my anxiety all started when I got this really bad bacteria infection that spread all over my arms and legs, and doctors never new what it was exactly. Ever since then I‚Äôve been thinking that everything is wrong with me. I had a really bad anxiety attack a couple weeks ago. I experienced everything from heart palpitations, weak legs, fast heart beat, etc. I went to the doctors and they said everything was fine, but that if I my palpitations became worse I should go to a cardiologist. That obviously put me into more of a panic mode. So for a week or two after that appointment the symptoms persisted until I came across something on YouTube. Those YouTube recommendations are the devil lol. It was a video about someone who had fibrodysplasia, if that‚Äôs how you spell it. Which I think is basically their whole body can become stuck if it encounters trauma or something. It‚Äôs really rare but I still thought I had it. 

I‚Äôve talked to my parents, but they think I‚Äôm going mental. I really wish I could stop this, but I know it will be a long process.

Now this week on my diagnosis I think I‚Äôm going to have a brain aneurysm. I been have these shocking pains in my head and some pressure. I know that they‚Äôre pretty rare in young people, but I still have constant worry.

Brain aneurysm 
Colon cancer 
Heart disease
Heart attack 
Lymphoma  
Glaucoma 
Fibromyalgia
Brain tumor
Nerve problems
Leukemia
Breast cancer

The work issue is that a co-worker was recently arrested for domestic violence. I found out because she just didn't show up for work one day. We knew how her boyfriend was and the troubles she was going through with him. I was so worried we would go to her house and find a dead body. 

We didn't. But she texted the boss that he pulled a gun on her and she was headed to jail. The news said he was choking her and she beat him with a hammer. 

Well now they are both out and my spidery senses are tingling. The boss is continuing to let her work despite the other charges against her. But I have been told by her about his issues and drug usage and how he continued to break in to her house even though she kicked him out multiple times.

I feel so unsafe going back to work. I took the weekend off to get my head straight... But I am not sure where I am in my head space. I had a wrong number text and it was from a male with the same name and I was flooded with panic.

I grew up in a big city so taking the train was something that I was used to and it never bothered me before, but recently in the past few years I started developing this irrational fear of the trains malfunctioning and being trapped inside it without any escape route if I needed one. Even if the train were to stop moving for just a few seconds because maybe there was another train in front of it, my brain would immediately flood with thoughts like ""Oh no we're stuck, I'm trapped. If I get a panic attack everyone on this train will see."" And my heart would start pounding, my throat would tighten, and I'd feel like I can't breathe. But once the train starts moving again the panic subsides.

It's so frustrating because a majority of how I commute is via the trains so it's not like it's something I can just avoid. 

I've mostly just been barely dealing with it using breathing techniques or distracting myself with my phone, but I'm not sure if those are enough sometimes.

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a big city so taking the train was something that I was used to and it never bothered me before, but recently in the past few years I started developing this irrational fear of the trains malfunctioning and being trapped inside it without any escape route if I needed one. Even if the train were to stop moving for just a few seconds because maybe there was another train in front of it, my brain would immediately flood with thoughts like &amp;quot;Oh no we&amp;#39;re stuck, I&amp;#39;m trapped. If I get a panic attack everyone on this train will see.&amp;quot; And my heart would start pounding, my throat would tighten, and I&amp;#39;d feel like I can&amp;#39;t breathe. But once the train starts moving again the panic subsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so frustrating because a majority of how I commute is via the trains so it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s something I can just avoid. &lt;/p&gt;

Whenever my anxiety shoots up, or after having episodes, I always come here, and I‚Äôm so glad there are people who can discuss and understand my anxiety issues.

It‚Äôs really not easy but having people, a community, to support each other makes it so much better to live by.

Thank you so much","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;...for this sub to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
