Basically my story is I've had anxiety since I was really little and it got diagnosed at around the age of 15. I've been diagnosed with quite a lot of things but it's gone back and fourth between GAD and panic disorder. It was so bad I couldn't go into grocery stores, got pulled out of high school for 3 months, and was basically trapped in my house. 

I eventually got therapy and I got medication. The therapy helped a bit but the medication hasn't. I've been on so many medications now I worry I'm basically out if options. I have a weird issue where I get rare side effects and my body can't tolerate even normal doses of medication. 

I did end up going to college (I'm so proud I got myself to go) and am currently in my senior year. I've either been extraordinary sick (I have other medical issues as well) or anxious the entire time. This has led to no sleep, brain fog, and actually missing college. Which then has led to barely passing in almost every class (not for lack of trying) and I now worry how it will affect my career (I'm majoring in food science).

I try my best to get a job, but 99% of the places i apply to never even reply, and for the 1% that do, the interviews make me so anxious that i constantly fuck up.

I had an interview today with a local mcdonalds, a place where 2 of my friends work, which i was told is an easy interview and that I'd definitely get the job. I'm in desperate need of a job, and im in no position to turn down this opportunity, so i spent about 4 hours getting ready for it, dressing nice, researching questions and so on.

But because my cities public transport is terrible, i ended up having to get another bus, and i was likely going to be 10 minutes late, despite leaving plenty of time to get there.

Going to interviews is already incredibly stressful for me, and the idea of being late to one this important just terrified me, and so i just went home. Considering i couldn't even bring myself to just go to the interview for a job that im not even that excited for, makes it really hard to not think that I'm just useless at everything and ill never get anything important done.

I know that with more practice with actual interviews ill probably lose alot of the anxiety i have about them, but since ive only been offered 3 interviews in the past 6 months means thats not gonna happen.

3 weeks ago I decided to drink a Red Bull (I never ever intake caffeine, I am sensitive to it) on the way home from my weekend job in order to not fall asleep at the wheel, I stopped at the local 7-11 and grabbed the large version of Red Bull since it was on sell...I drank the entire can on the way home. 

As I lay in bed that night eating chips, I realized two hours had already passed (2AM) and I was still up phone surfing... I vaguely could sense my heart beating in my chest and figured I’d had to much caffeine, when this happens let’s say if I drank a large cup of coffee once in a blue, I would just drink water to balance my blood out. So this is what I did...I pounded about 32oz of water. 

2 more hours had passed, and my heart was now pounding, long story short I started googling “what happens from drinking too much RED BULL” and after reading the horror stories I had a full blown panic attack and went to the ER.

They did a full work up at the ER and everything turned out fine! I went home and slept. The first week after the ER I felt a little weird, like I was starting to get sick. Minor headache, fatigue, weakness... at the beginning of the 2nd week I started having random panic attacks! I’ve had overall 5 panic attacks in 3 weeks, with unknown triggers.

1 week after my 1st ER visit ( been to the ER 3x smh) i started experiencing debilitating symptoms. I’m not really concerned about the panic attacks because I am getting used to them and I know that they are just me being irrational. I’m mostly concerned about my symptoms that will not go away and last constantly throughout the day going on 4 weeks now.

Including severe headaches, dizziness, dry mouth, heart palpitations, muscle spasms, tremors, weak legs, total loss of appetite and the most horrid one INSOMNIA. Only getting between 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 3 weeks. Needles to say I was forced to quit my weekend job, had to prioritize all my limited energy to my full time gig.

I can understand the symptoms are all in my head, but my question is...will this feeling of constant sympathetic nervous system activation last forever? I don’t know if I’m suffering from depression or if my body is constantly pumping out cortisol due to the lack of sleep. I can deal with having a panic attack every now and again but this constant feeling of gloom is taking a toll on me. I feel on edge constantly throughout the day. Will I ever enjoy life again? I desperately do not want to be put on any meds ESPECIALLY BENZOS!!!! Will I ever sleep again?

I think everyone's anxiety is completely unique to an individual like a finger print. Years and years have passed and I'm starting to come to the conclusion that anxiety can change to suit a situation, it alters the way it affects you the way it gets on top and inside of  you. Everytime you learn to deal with a particular type of anxiety related to a scenario and you feel like you've found how to manage it. Everything changes and you start the fight all over again. Then other times you think, ""everything's been ok for a while maybe it's acutally gone this time"" then surprise there comes the drowning feeling again. I truly belive, despite failed counciling that there's a trigger a true cause and source that sets the mind onto dealing with thoughts badly causing anxiety. Like a door that you can accidently open without knowing you opened it one day. There's been multiple attempts at changing the cause personally. A career change, a partner change, a lifestyle change. I think the problem or cause changes over time but that door in the mind, that pathway is already open. So as new scenarios arise your stuck to having to deal with anxiety. There always seems to be a feeling of emptiness there too. You can have a house, a nice car a job. It's never enough, having things and even success. It's almost as if the mind needs to find something to feed the anxiety to keep it occupied. There's times where jumping on a plane and starting again seems a rational idea. But it's all useless when your taking the prison with you. This the most honnest I've ever been with myself about anxiety. Rant over.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting here. I think everyone&amp;#39;s anxiety is completely unique to an individual like a finger print. Years and years have passed and I&amp;#39;m starting to come to the conclusion that anxiety can change to suit a situation, it alters the way it affects you the way it gets on top and inside of  you. Everytime you learn to deal with a particular type of anxiety related to a scenario and you feel like you&amp;#39;ve found how to manage it. Everything changes and you start the fight all over again. Then other times you think, &amp;quot;everything&amp;#39;s been ok for a while maybe it&amp;#39;s acutally gone this time&amp;quot; then surprise there comes the drowning feeling again. I truly belive, despite failed counciling that there&amp;#39;s a trigger a true cause and source that sets the mind onto dealing with thoughts badly causing anxiety. Like a door that you can accidently open without knowing you opened it one day. There&amp;#39;s been multiple attempts at changing the cause personally. A career change, a partner change, a lifestyle change. I think the problem or cause changes over time but that door in the mind, that pathway is already open. So as new scenarios arise your stuck to having to deal with anxiety. There always seems to be a feeling of emptiness there too. You can have a house, a nice car a job. It&amp;#39;s never enough, having things and even success. It&amp;#39;s almost as if the mind needs to find something to feed the anxiety to keep it occupied. There&amp;#39;s times where jumping on a plane and starting again seems a rational idea. But it&amp;#39;s all useless when your taking the prison with you. This the most honnest I&amp;#39;ve ever been with myself about anxiety. Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;

The title speaks for this post. I'll go into a little more detail down below, so consider this a:

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*Trigger Warning\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Every morning when I get up for work I am extremely anxious to the point that I can hardly breathe. It starts before I wake up and I can feel it in my dreams. From there, my eyes never leave the clock once I'm awake for when my day has to begin. Usually in that time I end up vomiting, sometimes twice. I begin to think of when I was younger and miss when things were ""easy"". I start to cry thinking about my family and how much I miss them since I moved out 3 years ago. The whole feeling can last either up until I sit down to work or even goes through a solid chunk of my day. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my third job in the last three years that I have had this anxiety for. I left the previous jobs thinking that my work anxiety was a result of the jobs themselves, and things were good at this new job for a while, but then it went sideways again. Every job that I have ever had has made me feel this way before going in, but this most recent job I think takes the cake. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this job I work from home. My wife says that I have it good since I get to be home with our puppy, I don't have to commute unless I have a meeting with someone. I work in insurance as an investigator and I call people to question them about various things ranging from car accidents to falls. After I call them and give them a line of questioning, I have to meet them in person at their home to record their statement. This process takes a good hour and a half depending on the amount of questions. I then have to sometimes go out and take pictures of scenes, knock on random people's doors to question them about accidents, meet with attorneys, etc. It is all just continuously building up making me more and more anxious. To make matters worse, I work hand-in-hand with the owner of the company on a daily basis as he helps me to get my work done. I started only 2 1/2 months ago and I already have amassed a giant list of cases that I was told I wouldn't see for a while. It makes it hard to keep track of all the things I have to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to do at this point. I wait for the weekends, but when they come, all I think about is how much time I have before I have to go back to work that upcoming Monday morning. The whole ordeal makes me want to curl up into a ball and hide away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a counselor that I speak with, and I am currently on Buspar and Propranalol. I've spoken with my counselor and he believes that it is a phobia as well. I don't know what to do. I can't quit my job as my wife and I just bought a house and our funds would deplete in no time but a part of me wants to quit. I feel like I keep running but the anxiety always catches up to me sooner or later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any tips or advice they can provide? I know this was a long post. I just don't know what to do anymore. i just wish that I could have been born normal and not care about work like some people do, or at least if they hate it to just complain and move on with their day. It is constantly on my mind night and day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my hazy memory, the bullying wasn't super duper bad. I mean compared to the ones I've heard ahaha. But what affected me the most during that short 1 year would be being ostracised by my classmates. Since I spend about 90% of my school hours with my classmates, it really affected me nearly every single day. But thankfully, my determination to have friends was strong enough for me to force myself to join interest groups, making many friends outside of class. Hence why I would say that the whole ordeal only lasted for 1 year (THANKFULLY AHAHA one of the few things I'm proud of my 13 year old self for :'&gt;)

But the effects of the whole ostracism thing and bullying left its brutal mark, even 4 years on. I ended up having this facade that is pretty much the person I wish I really am, and the person that pretty much almost everyone sees and interacts with. A sociable, fun-loving and carefree girl who just loves to joke around and would act somewhat hyper and loud.  While I do have my own group of friends now, and consider myself to be generally quite likable among my peers, I find it nearly impossible to connect to people deeper in person. I am not one who would sit down with a friend, and just talk about anything that's not what the facade I've held up would talk about. I can only talk about the deeper things through text messages where I know that people won't be there to judge me right at my face, and I can also choose how I want to say it. This problem really affects me now because I really do want to have people I can call as ""close friends""  and share anything about freely, but it's near impossible.

Another thing is that the fear of being abandoned by any of my friends, having a hole in my social circle still keeps me up at night. The second I assume a friend is ""going to leave me"", I enter this state of panic, having emotional breakdowns, crying myself to sleep, doing anything to make them stay, even if it means sacrificing all my time and exhausting my own body out. It would last for days to weeks and it sucks a lot. Whenever those episodes happen, it feels impossible for me to cope with anything really. In a way, those assumptions are the main triggers for all those episodes which really sucks because I might end up actually destroying a friendship with all those idk ""attempts"" to make that friend, who probably wasn't leaving me in any way to begin with, stay. 

I don't know what to do, I feel like I don't have anyone close to confide to, and I am constantly on the lookout for any signs of any one of my friends ""abandoning me"". I don't think my parents would send me to get any help because I still act like any normal person in front of them and everyone else thanks to that front. I am scared that if I visit my school counsellor, my classmates might find out and they would think that I am weak,and just leave me (strange thought I know, and I am really sorry if this part offended anyone I sincerely don't think like that about anyone going for counselling, I only think like that when it comes to me going for counselling). I am also just not sure what to even TELL a counsellor or a therapist, since I am pretty sure I'll just act and say things that I am totally fine and that my problems are petty and stuff. I have always felt that I might have some degree of anxiety, especially after 4 years, but because I don't really...how should I put this...look like someone who has it? I just behave like a normal teenage girl that's extremely sociable and loud. But I'm constantly worried over things, and often felt afraid that people are talking bad about me, or beating myself up over what I said or did in social situations.I don't like self-diagnosing myself either so I would always remind myself that many people experience actual anxiety and I probably am just thinking too much.

I just want all of this to stop, and I don't know how. I haven't had another episode in 6 months now thankfully, but I don't know when I'll have another one and what to do to prevent &amp; stop it. What can I do?

Hello everyone. I'm here to ask some advice. I've never travel by plain until very recently. I got a boyfriend from an island so I have to take a plane to visit. I travel twice last year and just had the third flight. Until now I've always had my boyfriends company. But at the end of the year I was supposed to come for New years and meet him here since he comes before me for Christmas, so I'll need to fly alone. 

Now, to the problem. I suffer from depression and anxiety, so I think this happens because of it. When the plain stars going up I lose track of what's up and down. I get really disoriented and I get really dizzy. My blood seems to go to my feet, (normal I guess?) and i start to gave breathing problems and panic attacks. In the middle of all of this I fell like I'm about to pass out and that worries me.

Só, I wanted to ask this community :
1 - are these inicial feelings normal?
2 - Is it OK if I pass out?
3 - should I tell a fly attendance about this before the flight? Or my neighbors?
4 - should I go to the doctor and ask for something?

I've had anxiety for years, mostly big panics in stressful situations. I was taking citalopram for depression for about a year until last month but came off because it made me feel really emotionally blunted, but I haven't had any other treatment or therapy for mental health stuff.

To make a long story short, I've been working at this company for around 3 years. My wife is pregnant and due in the next few months. I have parental leave of around 2+ months, so I'm incredibly excited for that. However, I have a coworker I work directly next to who puts me down on a daily basis. I'm in my late 20's, and we work at an offsite location with only about 15 other people. Said coworker is older and about to retire. 

Without getting into details, she bad mouths me to upper management, berates me, puts me down, denigrates me and ultimately makes me feel like a total piece of shit who does nothing right. There is a manager who sits across from us who has done nothing, besides the fact he has been obviously hearing her for the past 2 years (yes, it's s been this way for 2 years). But lately she's really hit at me hard, and made me look and feel like a complete and total idiot in front of my other coworkers. 

I'm now at the point where I can't quit because I want to have said parental leave to enjoy with my newborn. At the same time, my working life has become almost unbearable, to the point I am anxious walking in to work every day. Its escalated in the past week, to a point I went home and cried because I never have felt so bad about myself, and I'm ashamed to talk with my wife about it. I've never been around someone so negative. 

I feel like there are other employees she has bad mouthed me to, and makes me out to be a careless idiot. Recently, she took the opportunity to follow up on a mistake I made to get credit for herself, rather than telling me about my mistake. 

Please send me some good vibes guys, I'm gonna be a dad in a few months but honestly, I'm wanting to cry almost every day because of this.

Something happened. I smoked too much, too fast. I'm not entirely sure. My heart was RACING. I went home woke up my parents about 3 hours later I calmed down. That's where it all started

From ages 16-17 I had constant panic attacks out of nowhere. I wasn't even doing anything or thinking anything that could trigger it. It was the fear that the same thing would happen again. I would put so much stress on myself to not think about it and would end up a panicked mess. I was worried about everything ""what's this bump? "" "" Why do I have this pain in my head?"" I saw a therapist for about 6 months. It was reassuring. It calmed me down. I also saw a doctor and had my blood sugars tested. I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia (non diabetic). This was triggering panic attacks. I managed it. I was eating more often and the anxiety was pretty much gone. 

I had a daughter at 20. The scariest thing to ever happen to me. Still everything was fine. I would have mild anxious thoughts and feelings but knew it was likely because my blood sugar was low. I would eat and then I was fine.

Fast forward to about 3 months ago ( I am 26 years old now) I was at a staff meeting at work and a co worker ( she has anxiety triggered by PTSD ) was sitting beside me she fell ontop  of me and began shaking. She was not concious. I didn't know at the time but she has tremors from time to time. instant panic attack. I had to remove myself from the situation. Not only had I never witnessed anything like that before but definitely not with someone I knew.

This is where it all starts again. I work with her everyday. Will this happen again? Can this happen to me? Terrifying. I have made my peace with this but it has triggered anxiety just like before. I had come so far with my anxiety and being able to manage it without medication. Now I feel like a wreck. I am not sleeping at night. I wake up multiple times. I am tired. I feel weak. I'm shaking. Mind racing. I am in constant fear of feeling panic that I can never calm myself down to a point where I am not thinking about feeling anxious. I hate being alone. What if I choke? What if I am with my daughter and something happens and she doesn't know what to do?


last week I had a major panic attack at work. Due to low blood sugar. I think anyways. I am normally able to feel my body getting weak and my mind getting cloudy and that's when I know it's time to eat something. Not this time. I felt woozy. Instant panic. I drank some juice 15 minutes later and I still was pacing around the building. The fear of something worse happening "" Am I going to faint? Am I going to have a seizure? "" This can happen in extreme cases  if your blood sugar gets too low. 

I called my mom, she came to get me. I went home. It took a few hours but I calmed down. I had not had a panic attack like that in a very long time. it's almost like re living it for the first time again. I went to work the next day made it about an hour in and I was so anxious that it would happen again I left. Friday I made it through the whole day. It was the longest day ever. I was anxious. Talking myself down the entire time. Constantly thinking about it. How can I not?
It's Monday. I had an OK weekend. I felt very tired. Nervous for Monday. I woke up this morning sick to my stomach. I got sick a few times and called in. I feel ashamed. Am I actually Ill? Is it my anxiety? How can I live if I am too anxious to work for fear that the most embarrassing thing to me (having a panic attack in public) is going to happen again. Is it too fresh in my mind?

The thought of going to the grocery store makes me nervous, out to lunch, out with friends. How do I live like this? I can't.

I have made a doctor's appointment for the end of the month. I am going to discuss having my blood sugars re tested. I am scared I could be diabetic. I still don't want to rely on anti anxiety medication for the rest of my life but I can't live like this. I have been in this state for months now and it feels like a lifetime.

So long story short, I withdrew off a pain medication (gabapentin) I was taking for back pain. I realised it wasn’t doing anything to help the pain so suddenly decided to stop taking it.

I started having the feeling of adrenaline in my stomach that almost feels like it’s burning and then I start needing a wee and get acid reflux. Usually when I’ve had this I end up falling asleep anyway it’s like my body just gives in but last night I saw every hour in😢... is there anything I can do to stop that horrible feeling in my stomach..

## Anxiety? I don’t know her.

Does this sound familiar to you, dear reader with anxious thoughts? If it does, I just want to diffuse the bomb and let you know that you are okay. Everything will be alright. Your brain isn’t fucked, you are healthy, and you will not die. Got it? Now, let’s move on…

Although a lot of people seem too afraid to speak about it, a lot of people face anxious thoughts all the time. Do you know what it means to have anxiety?? It means you are a normal human being with an overactive brain. What usually causes anxiety is a big change or an uncomfortable circumstance in your life. This happened to me around the same time I got ready to go to college.

## The Common Mistake

The most common and easiest thing to do when anxiety appears is to try to “shoo” it away like a fly in your kitchen. Let me tell you what happens next…

You avoid anxiety.

When you avoid anxiety, you begin to fear anxiety.

When you fear anxiety, it creates the anxiety loop.

The anxiety loop is the reason it keeps happening.

## More Gasoline, Please…

The more you avoid anxiety, the more frequent and intense the anxiety loop occurs. Think of it like pouring a bottle of gasoline on a bonfire. The only reason I know this is because it was my life for over a year and a half.

I think you can agree with me that having this feeling sucks. All of the different and odd sensations related to anxiety suck. Most of all, not being able to live the life you want will suck the most. We only have one life, and no one wants to spend it being trapped by their fear and worries.

## [The Solution](https://evanwithcoffee.com/i-love-you-anxiety/)?

Stop avoiding anxiety. Now. Right this second. Stop.

Now that we solved the logical part of this issue, now we must face the *much*, much harder emotional part…

## What Good Comes Out of Anxiety?

Actually, a lot. Like I mentioned before, you have an overactive brain. This means that you aren’t dumb. Although anxiety can drain your energy and make you feel “sluggish” sometimes (from personal experience), you are smarter than most people because you are constantly analyzing everything. You are also likely to be motivated and very hard on yourself.

There have been numerous studies done on that prove an increase in creativity and intelligence with individuals with anxiety. A few famous examples of people that were believed to have anxiety are Emily Dickinson and Sir Isaac Newton. Two smart, creative, and super influential people, right?

## What Should I Do??

Love your anxiety. Understand that it’s normal to have it. It’s a part of being an intelligent human. Don’t be afraid to reach out to someone you trust to talk about it. This will seriously make such a big difference. There isn’t anything wrong with you at all, you’re actually just thinking too much.

No matter what, you might have anxious thoughts come and go. The difference is how you approach them. If you try to avoid them, you will cause that painful anxiety loop. If you face them and acknowledge that it is completely normal but it’s going to suck… Soon enough, you’ll start to notice they will become less frequent and less intense.

## The Goal?

The goal is to enjoy your life. Do what you would be doing if you didn’t have anxiety. Don’t spend the time and energy avoiding it and trying to get rid of it. Instead, love it just like you love yourself.

Trust me, guys and girls… I will have a lot more to give you on the topic of anxiety. This is only the start. When explaining, I try to keep it simple and fun. Looking at a bunch of long-ass words and scientific terms will only confuse you and probably make you more anxious.

But for now, remember, love your anxiety. Don’t try and avoid it. :)

The rapid thumping of the pulse. Meanwhile, you’re standing still in the lobby, waiting for someone to unlock the door for your meeting. It doesn’t matter where you are. It could be the airport, it could be your own bed. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing either. You could be driving home, or sitting in a boring lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck is wrong with me?!” It’s that question you will ask repeatedly. At the same time, you are scared to death of it coming back again… But wait… Shit, here it comes again.. AHH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety? I don’t know her.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar to you, dear reader with anxious thoughts? If it does, I just want to diffuse the bomb and let you know that you are okay. Everything will be alright. Your brain isn’t fucked, you are healthy, and you will not die. Got it? Now, let’s move on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of people seem too afraid to speak about it, a lot of people face anxious thoughts all the time. Do you know what it means to have anxiety?? It means you are a normal human being with an overactive brain. What usually causes anxiety is a big change or an uncomfortable circumstance in your life. This happened to me around the same time I got ready to go to college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Common Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common and easiest thing to do when anxiety appears is to try to “shoo” it away like a fly in your kitchen. Let me tell you what happens next…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You avoid anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you avoid anxiety, you begin to fear anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fear anxiety, it creates the anxiety loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anxiety loop is the reason it keeps happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More Gasoline, Please…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you avoid anxiety, the more frequent and intense the anxiety loop occurs. Think of it like pouring a bottle of gasoline on a bonfire. The only reason I know this is because it was my life for over a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you can agree with me that having this feeling sucks. All of the different and odd sensations related to anxiety suck. Most of all, not being able to live the life you want will suck the most. We only have one life, and no one wants to spend it being trapped by their fear and worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://evanwithcoffee.com/i-love-you-anxiety/""&gt;The Solution&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop avoiding anxiety. Now. Right this second. Stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we solved the logical part of this issue, now we must face the &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, much harder emotional part…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Good Comes Out of Anxiety?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, a lot. Like I mentioned before, you have an overactive brain. This means that you aren’t dumb. Although anxiety can drain your energy and make you feel “sluggish” sometimes (from personal experience), you are smarter than most people because you are constantly analyzing everything. You are also likely to be motivated and very hard on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous studies done on that prove an increase in creativity and intelligence with individuals with anxiety. A few famous examples of people that were believed to have anxiety are Emily Dickinson and Sir Isaac Newton. Two smart, creative, and super influential people, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Should I Do??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love your anxiety. Understand that it’s normal to have it. It’s a part of being an intelligent human. Don’t be afraid to reach out to someone you trust to talk about it. This will seriously make such a big difference. There isn’t anything wrong with you at all, you’re actually just thinking too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, you might have anxious thoughts come and go. The difference is how you approach them. If you try to avoid them, you will cause that painful anxiety loop. If you face them and acknowledge that it is completely normal but it’s going to suck… Soon enough, you’ll start to notice they will become less frequent and less intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Goal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to enjoy your life. Do what you would be doing if you didn’t have anxiety. Don’t spend the time and energy avoiding it and trying to get rid of it. Instead, love it just like you love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, guys and girls… I will have a lot more to give you on the topic of anxiety. This is only the start. When explaining, I try to keep it simple and fun. Looking at a bunch of long-ass words and scientific terms will only confuse you and probably make you more anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, remember, love your anxiety. Don’t try and avoid it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a special education paraeducator. I love it! The kids are great, and my boss (the teacher), is also very friendly. 

Today, I had a panic attack while accompanying one of my students to her work experience site off campus. For some reason, I always feel safer and more secure when I know that I can go to my car and drive myself home if needed. Well, in this case, I was off campus and my car was in the school parking lot a few miles away. I just excused myself to the bathroom for 15 minutes. While I was in there, I googled therapists in my area and made phone calls to request an appointment to distract myself from the physical symptoms. I didn’t bawl my eyes out like last time, so yay!

It’s been about an hour since the panic attack. I’m heading back to campus now. I’m still waiting to hear back from a therapist. I’m still feeling kinda weak and faint. It’s the physical symptoms that scare me. I always feel like I’m about to pass out when I’m in the middle of a panic attack. Right now, I’m afraid that I’ll have another one today.

I’m a special education paraeducator. I love it! The kids are great, and my boss (the teacher), is also very friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I had a panic attack while accompanying one of my students to her work experience site off campus. For some reason, I always feel safer and more secure when I know that I can go to my car and drive myself home if needed. Well, in this case, I was off campus and my car was in the school parking lot a few miles away. I just excused myself to the bathroom for 15 minutes. While I was in there, I googled therapists in my area and made phone calls to request an appointment to distract myself from the physical symptoms. I didn’t bawl my eyes out like last time, so yay! I also always pack a snack whenever I take my student to work experience because hunger makes everything worse for me. &lt;/p&gt;

6 months ago I had my first panic attack after my arm ended up going numb from what was diagnosed as a pinched nerve when i thought it was a heart attack. The first couple months was terrible, I was having multiple panic attacks a day and could barely sleep feeling as I was going to die in my sleep. I had constant chest pain from Costochondritus neck pain and arm pain in the shoulder.

Over the course of the last 6 months my chest pain is now less severe and less constant but my arm pain is starting to branch outward into my bicep/tricep area and near my elbow. I also get sharp chest pain that lasts a couple seconds. My heart rate throughout the day resting is a constant 66-72 BPM and I do not have High Blood Pressure.

Last couple days I've had some weird palpitations one from after having a large bowel movement that caused my heart rate to increase to around 90-100 and cause lightheaded symptoms. And another today happened when i was laying on my stomach I felt a very hard forceful contraction that caught my attention but didn't cause any symptoms.

I've had 10+ EKGs all coming back normal, event monitor that I wore for an entire month normal, a whole series of blood tests that came back normal, Chest X-Rays that didn't show anything. Stress test that came back normal as well. Everyone I see tells me that I am a healthy 26 year old with no health problems but I still have a hard time believing them when I have these symptoms.

Before I had these issues I was an active individual who would spend 30-60 minutes a day doing cardio and another 30-40 weight lifting, never had any problems. Now it seems when i do anything strenuous afterwards I feel tired but no symptoms.

I need some questions answered from people who have experienced Anxiety/Generalized Anxiety/Panic Disorder

1) Does Anxiety cause pain in the upper and lower arm and shoulder as well as chest pain?

2) Does Anxiety cause shortness of breath or make you feel like its impossible to take a long deep breath all day?

3) Is there any other tests I need to take to rule out heart problems?

4) How do i know if my heart is 100% okay so i can stop worrying about it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit, I need some help. &lt;/p&gt;

I’ve managed to calm down a little so I’m not really shaking anymore but I had that horrible amped up adrenaline rush for a long time. 

There’s a guy who came into our office and asked my boss about me after I left. That was last week and I was a bit anxious after just wondering why but that seemed like the end of it. Then today when we were all out to lunch, he brought it up again and said the guy mentioned stopping by soon to get him to sign something and everyone started joking about it. He had sent me a text with a screenshot from the guy. 

I was under the impression this guy was about 45 years old but it turns out he’s only 4 years older than me and apparently super awkward (join the club) so asking who the girl in the [color] shirt was was probably his way of expressing interest. I repel most guys and am totally unlucky in love (and unlucky in general), have been hung up on the same guy for almost 2 1/2 years, and, thanks to anxiety and depression and still living at home with my parents, I just can’t seem to put myself out there and meet people. All I knew was I was not interested in this guy or having to potentially deal with any awkwardness. 

A few months ago, a guy at my part time retail job asked me out and it was super uncomfortable. He was older and really not attractive (I’m not much to write home about and I value intelligence, humor, and kindness above everything else, but I am human and I know what my type is physically) on top of being creepy. 

I wrote a whole novel-length text (it’s my signature style) to my friend explaining the situation and asked why the only guys interested in me are trolls and lamenting the whole thing in general. I realized I sent it to my boss as soon as I did it and told him right away (we were all at a table) and everyone joked about it a bit and I asked if he’d please delete it which was just laughed off, not that I can blame him, so I’m sure he read it. I spent the rest of lunch silent just stewing in my own embarrassment and shame and couldn’t finish my lunch. He’s super cool and I know I’m not going to get fired over this or anything (and luckily didn’t curse, unless “wtf” counts, or say anything negative about him or any other coworkers) but I definitely came off as a total bitch in the text and since it was meant for a good friend of mine I was being particularly dramatic about the whole thing. I just feel completely humiliated. 

Should I send a text and apologize? I just don’t know what to do or how to address it but I feel like I have to say SOMETHING. I just feel sick about this. Normally I confide in my mom but she’d want to know what the text was about and I think she’d probably be upset (not mad or anything, just like embarrassed and worried for me, which would only make me feel worse) and the last thing I need is for her to question why I don’t just go for it with this guy/any guy (I’m also a 20-something who is lucky to have a great relationship with my parents but I **need** to become more self-reliant and have to stop telling them **everything**)  so it just feels like this huge weight on my chest. I don’t know how I’m going to get any work done today, nor do I know how I’m going to show my face in here tomorrow. I know in the grand scheme of things this is minor and won’t matter in a month but of course anxiety makes me feel like it’s so huge and like something terrible is going to happen as a result","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had my Fitbit on today because my heart rate is insane.

I realized I sent it to my boss as soon as I did it and told him right away (we were all at a table) and everyone joked about it a bit and I asked if he’d please delete it which was just laughed off, not that I can blame him, so I’m sure he read it. I spent the rest of lunch silent just stewing in my own embarrassment and shame and couldn’t finish my lunch. He’s super cool and I know I’m not going to get fired over this or anything (and luckily didn’t curse, unless “wtf” counts, or say anything negative about him or any other coworkers) but I definitely came off as a total bitch in the text and since it was meant for a good friend of mine I was being particularly dramatic about the whole thing. I just feel completely humiliated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I send a text and apologize? I just don’t know what to do or how to address it but I feel like I have to say SOMETHING. I just feel sick about this. Normally I confide in my mom but she’d want to know what the text was about and I think she’d probably be upset (not mad or anything, just like embarrassed and worried for me, which would only make me feel worse) and the last thing I need is for her to question why I don’t just go for it with this guy/any guy (I’m also a 20-something who is lucky to have a great relationship with my parents but I &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to become more self-reliant and have to stop telling them &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;)  so it just feels like this huge weight on my chest. I don’t know how I’m going to get any work done today, nor do I know how I’m going to show my face in here tomorrow. I know in the grand scheme of things this is minor and won’t matter in a month but of course anxiety makes me feel like it’s so huge and like something terrible is going to happen as a result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can&amp;#39;t keep racking up absences like she is now, so in the meantime, what can my parents do to help her literally just show up to the building?&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 months, and we both struggle with intense anxiety. Neither of us are seeing a therapist, so the only place for us to vent our anxieties is to each other. But since we're both such anxious people, the venting just makes both of our anxieties grow and grow to the point where we talk about little else. I am genuinely in love with her, but I'm worried that our anxieties don't compliment each other well at all, and that this is becoming an unhealthy relationship that needs to end. What should I do?  
**FULL SUMMARY:**  
My girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 months, and we're both very anxious people. I struggle with putting too much pressure on myself to always please everyone, and I make other people's happiness my responsibility, often forgetting to prioritize my own happiness. My girlfriend's anxiety is much more self-deprecating, in that she beats herself up over every little mistake she makes and often takes on a very passive role when we get into arguments. We also both constantly worry about the future.  
I really do love my girlfriend, but the entire time that her and I have been together I've felt my anxiety worsening. When we started dating, it was a year after I got out of a four-year long relationship (ex is now 22F) that was emotionally abusive and detrimental to my self-esteem. The year that I had in between relationships was incredibly productive, as I could finally prioritize my own happiness rather than that of a partner. When my current girlfriend and I started dating, my mental health was the best it's ever been. But since then, both of our anxieties have continued to intensify.  
We are both attending colleges in Colorado, but our schools are about two hours apart by bus, making frequent visitation difficult. We both struggle financially and therefore need to work during school, and we are both easily overwhelmed by schoolwork. All of these stressors build up in both of us, and we both get extremely anxious, over-worrying and over-thinking about every little thing in our lives, then beating ourselves up for getting anxious, which makes us feel worse, and on and on it goes. Neither of us currently see therapists, so our main outlet for venting our anxieties is to each other. It's gotten to the point where most days consist of one or both of us have an intense anxiety attack that the other partner is responsible for alleviating. Helping her with her anxieties makes me extremely anxious, and we get stuck in this vicious cycle, rarely feeling better for any significant amount of time. It's more and more exhausting everyday.  
This entire time, in the back of my mind, I've been wondering if my mental state would improve if I got out of this relationship. The vast majority of personal growth that I've undergone in recent years has been when I've been single, and I can't help but think that I would be less anxious, healthier, and overall happier on my own. But on the other hand, I do genuinely love her, and I'm tired of kicking people out of my life whenever I get anxious. I'm just so unsure about everything.  
I tried to break up with her on two separate occasions earlier this summer, and in both instances she convinced me that it was just my anxieties talking; that pushing a person who loves me away is only going to worsen my self-deprecating thoughts. She always tells me how much she loves me and that she thinks we can work through this. After each of those instances, I've felt better and more hopeful about the relationship for a few weeks or months, but then I eventually return to wanting to end it. Last night I brought it up again, and now we're in a stalemate, unsure of what to do. I feel totally unable to decide what it is that I really *want*, whether it's continuing or ending the relationship. This super-long post is a pretty accurate depiction of the anxiety that I've been experiencing: persistent conflicting thoughts and increasingly vicious cycles. I need help finding the balance between thinking and *over*\-thinking about what it is that I want.

This started as occasional passing considerations but has now turned in to obsessive thoughts that connect to every little decision I make.

Eg I'll be in a store or out on a bike ride with a clear mind, and then it will pop in to my head - does this store have a bathroom? or is there a public bathroom I could get to quick enough on my bike. And then next thing I know, I feel this anxious drop in my stomach and a short while later actually feel like I could use the bathroom (not urgently, but just enough to keep it in my mind from that point on)

I also spent sometime on a hotline and was told that maybe talking about it on a forum would help.

I have NEVER had anxiety or depression.  Two months ago at work I got light headed and thought I was going to pass out - it hit me out of the blue.  No medical diagnosis found, said to likely be stress/anxiety hitting a breaking point for me.

I am in a very high stress, always on 24/7/365 type job.  I’m a high performer and never had an issue.  Ever since then, I’ve had social anxiety in crowded places and at work on the operations floor, a fear that I’ll pass out.  I have avoided time on the floor and interactions and events.

I was first given buspirone to try and took two in one day.  It made me feel spacey so I stopped.  Then came the Xanax.  It worked like a charm and helped me get back to the floor or make progress over things for the most part.  Then I felt I wasn’t getting past it so asked for more to help.  Went a saw a cognitive behavioral therapist.  Took no Xanax for three days and hit the biggest wall of depression and dark thoughts I’ve ever had.  Didn’t realize it was likely Xanax withdrawal.  Scared the shit out of me so asked for something to balance it all out, thinking maybe I was depressed and anxious, got Zoloft.

Had a horrific time on Zoloft.  Woke up midnight in a panic, terrible increased anxiety day three and four.  Felt like I was having anxiety constantly.  Took four doses and stopped.   Now trying Lexapro, on dose four.

I’m having a horrific time mentally overcoming this.  I don’t know that I need medicine like this, but my support system (wife/mother) says they think I do.  I am having awful anxiety and cannot stop thinking about it.  For example, I went to the store yesterday and knew I should’ve been uncomfortable but wasn’t.  That loss of control made me very anxious.  I feel like I’m spiraling into panic and anxiety.  My blood pressure sky rockets, my forehead tingles.  I’m not sure that coming off the meds and using CBT and maybe CBD oil isn’t the best approach.

Just could use some insight.  I’m on dose four of my Lexapro now.  Taking .25mg to .5mg of Xanax to sleep as I can’t get my mind off it.  Almost passed out in the shower this morning from stress and a panic attack - something I’ve never had before today.

Just can’t figure out which direction to go, but I think the medication and these experiences are bringing me to a breaking point and it’s scaring the shit out of me.  I don’t know if I’m worse because I’m scared of the meds or better on them.  I’m not suicidal and don’t feel down, but have a low appetite on the meds.

Appreciate any advice or thoughts!  I’ll be following so happy to answer any questions.

Hey guys.

So, I've never really been one to post about my real life issues on the internet, mainly because I never thought it would help. But now, knowing the state that I'm currently in, I've found that it really helps to at least know that other people understand and even relate to what I'm going through. My therapist mentioned getting involved with online forums, and my head went immediately to Reddit. Sure enough, I found this page. Not even 10 minutes of scrolling and nearly every post was something I could relate to, which was strangely comforting. 

I guess I just want to describe what my anxiety feels like in hopes that someone would understand? And maybe share how they've been coping with it. Anything helps.

I used to be a very extroverted person. I went to frat parties my freshman year of college and got wasted too many times from terrible mixed drinks. I was constantly surrounded by friends and avoided moments where I wasn't. Granted, I was NOT like this in high school and wanted university to be different. Now, I'm just now starting my senior year and it's as if I'm a different person. Just in April of this year, on my 21st birthday, I spent the entire day with friends; we went roller skating, to the casino, and ended the night with a campfire by the lake (and a few joints). It was the greatest birthday I've ever had. I felt free and just plain happy. Then suddenly, I wasn't.

I remember, right at the beginning of May this year, my heart was suddenly beginning to palpitate and beat faster. And for some reason, it did not stop for an entire week. It was as if I was in a constant and never ending panic. My body was tense and my leg would not stop bouncing. I shut myself away in my room to trudge through an 8 page essay that needed to be done by the end of the week (it was during finals, just my luck). On top of this, I was extremely nauseous and could not eat. Over the course of about 6 days the only thing I had eaten were a few crackers and a half a piece of peanut butter toast. Unintentionally starving myself was only making it worse. 

I would at my fucking wits end, I tell you. It was my lowest point EVER. And as a naturally optimistic person, it was absolutely discouraging. To suddenly not feel like yourself...it's weird. Thankfully, at the end of that week, my sister and her roommate helped me move out of my apartment for the summer back to their place in my hometown. As soon as I was home, I slowly began to eat, and the anxiety started to float away little by little. However, it wasn't long before it reared it's ugly head again. I had went to an escape room for my sister's birthday on the 20th or so of May, and had a full blown panic attack right there, as soon as the door was shut. I had to rush to the bathroom to puke (which is usually what happens when I have a panic attack) and I went home that night extremely confused. 

It wasn't until I finally got to see a psychiatrist a week later that she told me what I was dreading: panic disorder and agoraphobia. She described exactly what agoraphobia was to me, and it made so much sense. The immense fear of having a panic attack without the ability to escape was clouding my head anytime I left the house. There were certain situations I could talk myself out of avoiding, but certain places, like the movies or in a car on a road trip, even going on dates, were suddenly so terrifying. It's as if I had never done them before. And it just sucks. Hard.

Also, I've been talking to a guy I met on tinder for over a month and we have yet to meet (he was on campus and I was in my hometown). Now, we are most likely meeting this weekend and I'm absolutely fucking terrified. I've been on dates before and been fine, but fuck, I'm so petrified, even though this guy is VERY understanding and sweet about my anxiety. It's like my head won't let me believe it will be okay.

Any help? Advice? Suggestions? Do you relate? I'll take anything.

TL;DR I have not been able to do the things I used to and it's fucking terrible.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This post very briefly mentions drug use, trigger warning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve never really been one to post about my real life issues on the internet, mainly because I never thought it would help. But now, knowing the state that I&amp;#39;m currently in, I&amp;#39;ve found that it really helps to at least know that other people understand and even relate to what I&amp;#39;m going through. My therapist mentioned getting involved with online forums, and my head went immediately to Reddit. Sure enough, I found this page. Not even 10 minutes of scrolling and nearly every post was something I could relate to, which was strangely comforting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I just want to describe what my anxiety feels like in hopes that someone would understand? And maybe share how they&amp;#39;ve been coping with it. Anything helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a very extroverted person. I went to frat parties my freshman year of college and got wasted too many times from terrible mixed drinks. I was constantly surrounded by friends and avoided moments where I wasn&amp;#39;t. Granted, I was NOT like this in high school and wanted university to be different. Now, I&amp;#39;m just now starting my senior year and it&amp;#39;s as if I&amp;#39;m a different person. Just in April of this year, on my 21st birthday, I spent the entire day with friends; we went roller skating, to the casino, and ended the night with a campfire by the lake (and a few joints).

I haven't been to therapy in a couple of years (though I've done a fair share of it).

I've lived with anxiety for about ten years now. Or at least the kind of anxiety that I would call crippling. It started with panic attacks, I would get what I remember as attacks lasting for days, the first feeling in the morning would be a strong feeling of dread and fear of death, the last one before sleeping would be the same. This went on and off for a year or two and made me all kinds of depressed. I started on SSRI, and after a horrible month and a half it actually started getting better, but still, I was pretty broken. Think I hit the worst of it about 7 years ago, and I don't remember a lot from it, I took a lot of (prescribed)  pills, anything that would push the anxiety away and let me live a ""normal"" life (although hazy).

The only diagnose I've ever qualified for has been GAD (but boy did I qualify). I've had a lot of good things happen to me the last few years, and I'm certain I'm not depressed. I love life actually, love the people I have around me.

My worst fear, or the one that I battled the hardest, is that something would be wrong with my heart. I started getting heart palpitations (actually triggered most of my panic attacks back when they started), and I did a lot of in and out to the hospital to check if there was an issue. Nothing though, just anxiety, is the explanation. And I believe them (most of the time). But the last few months I've struggled a lot again. I've gotten a lot more palpitations and the last few days I've been feeling really weak. It's such an evil design that the symptoms for anxiety/GAD matches almost perfectly up with the signs that you have a heart problem. Read up on GAD again, it's been a while, and while it helped legitimising my feelings I just found it a bit that I've matched all the physiological symptoms today. So I got a bit fed up you know?

Anyway, going the the doctor tomorrow. Can't hurt checking if everything is fine, again. But it will be, and I will be as lost as before. I've wished sometimes that they actually would find something wrong with my heart, you know, deal with an operation or just some medication and boom, I'm back to living my life with all the cards on the table. Instead I've just got this invisible illness, that's so hard to explain, or be excused for, and I get medication (SSRI) that nobody really knows why it works (or in my case as of late, doesn't).

Yeah, I don't know. Thinking that venting will help me a little bit right now. I mean, it's not the worst, I've had it worse, but I'm annoyed that everything in my life is actually going well, and still my anxiety makes me feel that I'm on the brink of death. And I'm not sure what to try next, I've done a lot of therapy in different forms, I've tried a few different medications. And while I have had good periods, I'm just a bit tired of always defaulting back to this.

Thanks for reading.

Instead I&amp;#39;ve just got this invisible illness, that&amp;#39;s so hard to explain, or be excused for, and I get medication (SSRI) that nobody really knows why it works (or in my case as of late, doesn&amp;#39;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don&amp;#39;t know. Thinking that venting will help me a little bit right now. I mean, it&amp;#39;s not the worst, I&amp;#39;ve had it worse, but I&amp;#39;m annoyed that everything in my life is actually going well, and still my anxiety makes me feel that I&amp;#39;m on the brink of death. And I&amp;#39;m not sure what to try next, I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of therapy in different forms, I&amp;#39;ve tried a few different medications. And while I have had good periods, I&amp;#39;m just a bit tired of always defaulting back to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR anxious person lives anxious life&lt;/p&gt;

this was an emergency for me. i didn't have a place to stay and my boyfriend offered to have me stay with him for a little while til i can get my bearings. i didn't want to stay with him because of his roommate. i knew going into it that i'd have a hard time with the guy because i've heard that he's extremely social and needy, along with some not so nice things about him and i don't really think we'd get along. nonetheless, i have always encouraged my boyfriend to continue their friendship and not let me get in the middle of it because that's not my place at all.

since i've been staying here i don't really associate with his friend more than i have to, but i'm not a bitch by any means. i've tried to get to smile and laugh and answer all of his questions in a normal way. we've all gone to dinner once, sometimes share small talk in the kitchen together, and once i even went out with him to get smoothies when my boyfriend was at work even though i really didn't want to. i thought i should give him a chance and spend time with him.

anyways, i haven't even been here for a week and i'm still getting accustomed to things. when my boyfriend is at work, i basically stay in his room all day except for brushing my teeth and grabbing breakfast, because i feel like a guest and it isn't my place. i don't go out and associate with his roommate because i'm really awkward and anxious, but i do constantly let my boyfriend know that he should hang with him even if i stay in the room as they've been friends for a while. 

well, today, his roommate sent him a very long paragraph about how uncomfortable he feels because i dont leave the room unless its with my boyfriend. and how i don't show my face unless im 6 inches away from him. and how we don't invite him to our plans and when he invites us to do things we don't ever wanna go. he said he feels really awkward and he hopes that changes.

i'm not a social person and i don't go out of my way to befriend people. especially boys and especially when i'm a guest at someone's place and don't have any other choice but to be there anyway. this whole situation is making me feel really upset and like a bad person. 

i'd also like to say that im not trying to say i don't wanna get to know my boyfriend's friends. my friendships have always happened organically, and i don't like them to be forced upon me. if anything this made me feel even more uncomfortable and i just feel like if i werent so socially anxious i wouldnt have a problem with this. does anyone have any idea what i should do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;

It was only 3 years ago I started forcing myself on the short flights to mainland Uk (about 20mins) and I took some heavy anti-anxiety medication so I wasn’t basically hyperventilating under the seat I desperately tried to mentally scramble under. 

After some brute effort and a lot of distraction I’ve managed these small flights with only slight nail marks in the armrests. I have panic disorder so my anxiety goes from 0-100 in seconds. I take benzodiazepines to fly and have also found too much left me feeling awful and very drowsy... putting me out of action for a whole day after travelling.  Knowing this I’ve taken a lot of action to not rely on the medication and find other methods to cope. I very recently took a step further in my phobia battling and got on a 2 hour flight to Italy! This is the longest flight I’ve been on in about 8 years. It went surprisingly well and I was even calm enough to get out of my seat and wander to the loo. I could chat with my boyfriend and not obsess over every single plane noise. I’ll tell you how I cope; 


First, really get to know your triggers.. if it’s fear of dying in a ball of fire hurtling towards the ground (that was me) really look at the statistics (not air crash investigations) about 3 million people are up in the air daily and commercial planes have to be checked before every take off for even the most minor fault. Plane noises were huge triggers because as soon as there was a change or new noise I panicked like I alone had just discovered the fatal crash noise. Again look up these noises and what they mean.. changes in engine noise could just be the engine re-adjusting speed or could just be air hitting the engine. The best thing I heard that really helps me not focus on this was that air has currents and waves just like water, so of course this will sound a little different in the engine. 

Something I did was watch flight enthusiasts POV videos on YouTube... there’s mad people that film a flight from start to finish out of their window seat, and it helps with you adjusting to the normal noises. Also saw recently that flights can land safely and normally with only one engine.. I watched a plane I regularly get on land with one engine as if nothing was wrong! And it oddly re-assures me. 

Sometimes facts don’t put you at ease at all so I find reminding myself of why I’m facing the fear really motivates me.. I will not let my fear stop me from travelling. I will also remind myself that I mustn’t put my life on hold for an accident that is statistically less likely to happen to me than being struck by lightning. 

Accept your lack of control. You cannot control the outcome other than not getting on the flight... it which your outcome is reinforcing the fear. No matter what your anxiety tells you, worrying does not make undesirable outcomes less likely, so focus on distracting your attention... movies and noise cancelling headphones are a godsend. Install challenging games on your phone, brain teasers and number games... there’s evidence to suggest engaging your rational brain or very technical thoughts can stop your emotions heightening and re-focus your attention. 

And finally make yourself comfortable.. travel with someone you trust, wear your favourite comfies (screw the high flying style I’m in endurance and fight the fear mode!) get a travel cushion and your favourite hoodie, loose clothes are great, if your chest is tight it’s best your pants are not too!

Share your tips and if this helped, I’d love to hear from you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had until recently an extremely bad phobia of flying and I live on a small island.. not ideal. It was only 3 years ago I started forcing myself on the short flights to mainland Uk (about 20mins) and I took some heavy anti-anxiety medication so I wasn’t basically hyperventilating under the seat I desperately tried to mentally scramble under. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some brute effort and a lot of distraction I’ve managed these small flights with only slight nail marks in the armrests. I have panic disorder so my anxiety goes from 0-100 in seconds. I take benzodiazepines to fly and have also found too much left me feeling awful and very drowsy... putting me out of action for a whole day after travelling.  Knowing this I’ve taken a lot of action to not rely on the medication and find other methods to cope. I very recently took a step further in my phobia battling and got on a 2 hour flight to Italy! This is the longest flight I’ve been on in about 8 years. It went surprisingly well and I was even calm enough to get out of my seat and wander to the loo. I could chat with my boyfriend and not obsess over every single plane noise. I’ll tell you how I cope; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, really get to know your triggers.. if it’s fear of dying in a ball of fire hurtling towards the ground (that was me) really look at the statistics (not air crash investigations) about 3 million people are up in the air daily and commercial planes have to be checked before every take off for even the most minor fault. Plane noises were huge triggers because as soon as there was a change or new noise I panicked like I alone had just discovered the fatal crash noise. Again look up these noises and what they mean.. changes in engine noise could just be the engine re-adjusting speed or could just be air hitting the engine. The best thing I heard that really helps me not focus on this was that air has currents and waves just like water, so of course this will sound a little different in the engine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I did was watch flight enthusiasts POV videos on YouTube... there’s mad people that film a flight from start to finish out of their window seat, and it helps with you adjusting to the normal noises. Also saw recently that flights can land safely and normally with only one engine.. I watched a plane I regularly get on land with one engine as if nothing was wrong! And it oddly re-assures me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes facts don’t put you at ease at all so I find reminding myself of why I’m facing the fear really motivates me.. I will not let my fear stop me from travelling. I will also remind myself that I mustn’t put my life on hold for an accident that is statistically less likely to happen to me than being struck by lightning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept your lack of control. You cannot control the outcome other than not getting on the flight... it which your outcome is reinforcing the fear. No matter what your anxiety tells you, worrying does not make undesirable outcomes less likely, so focus on distracting your attention... movies and noise cancelling headphones are a godsend. Install challenging games on your phone, brain teasers and number games... there’s evidence to suggest engaging your rational brain or very technical thoughts can stop your emotions heightening and re-focus your attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally make yourself comfortable.. travel with someone you trust, wear your favourite comfies (screw the high flying style I’m in endurance and fight the fear mode!) get a travel cushion and your favourite hoodie, loose clothes are great, if your chest is tight it’s best your pants are not too! Fashion police be damned. &lt;/p&gt;

Long story short I feel like he’s not behaving like a little brother should. It’s to the point where I think he sees me as an outside person. 

We are halfway through our vacation to China and Japan. I can say that it’s been ruined by him. It was in China were we started arguing in public (More to it) Mostly because we wanted to see different things so we agreed to go separate ways. I failed because I have no knowledge about the metro system in both countries. 

That was then but now I know how to use it so I can freely travel alone. I only meetup with my brother when we are going to eat or when we wants to see the same attraction. 

Most of the arguments was started by me but he was the one who provokes it. I won’t write down all of it but the last arguments we had was about sim cards. 

I asked him about he’s opinion regarding the price and what GB I should get. He’s been to Japan before and can speak Japanese very well so he knows stuff that I don’t. He answered but negatively saying that I have low IQ for asking that. Then I proceeded to say something about him and it ended with him saying this: «Honestly no one understands your thought»

One day I was riding the public bus to school, I got up at my stop and started walking down the small steps, a lady behind me got up as well but after me so I was a few steps in front of her. I'm not sure how to explain this but there is no way I tripped her or made her trip.

Anyway so as I am down the bottom of the small steps she trips (I think the bus jolted back a bit or something, can't fully remember) and crashed into me. At first I didn't know what to do so I sort of stood there for a second before helping her up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway so she is fine but this dude (I guess it looked like I did from his angle)  gives me this look of disgust and says ""you aren't even going to say sorry"" I wanted to say something like ""I didn't trip her"" (but in a kind way, not like a dismissing way) but due to anxiety rising up I couldn't get the words out of my mouth, so I sort of just looked at him. He gives me another look and says ""of course you aren't"" in a really ""you are a brat"" type of way. I wanted to say something to explain but again anxiety stops me from speaking.

And if anyone wonders why I didn't just apologise, I used to constantly apologise for things that weren't my doing, so at the time I was trying to discipline myself not to apologise for things I didn't do. I also knew for a fact that I didn't trip her or make her fall.

First time poster here (31M), please don't judge too harshly. I need to give a bit of background to make it easier to understand why I'm having such a hard time quitting this bad habit.

As a result of a very tough childhood (caused by having a malignant narcissist of a mother and living in a really bad+dangerous place) I turned to self-harm in many ways when I was 13-14 as a way to cope with all the emotions I had to repress and all the anxiety that they and puberty caused, by ""many ways"" I mean from drinking and smoking to cutting.

After being a high performance functional alcoholic for years I decided to get psychological help to slow down and try to quit my vices as a way of coping with anxiety, because I was in a really bad place mentally and was considering suicide.

After 15+ years of smoking I quit cold turkey and I'm about to hit 1 year clean from nicotine and weed, I also went from 1 bottle of rum/gin every 2 days to 1 beer every 2 days (and sometimes I can go a whole week without a beer). I know it doesn't sound like much but it's been a really hard and uphill battle, everytime I smell cigs or see gin I'm tempted to fall back into the easy way of coping and it takes a lot of strength to stay clean and strong (I also haven't self harmed in almost a year, which is another victory I suppose).

One thing I have never managed to stop doing though was biting my nails. 

At my worst I would chew into the skin itself or use manicure tools to cut myself further, usually causing infections which I hid and treated on my own, because if found out I'd face shame and humilliation from my narcissist parent.

Nowadays I'm No Contact with her, but her attempts at boundary stomping despite me blocking her from everything, moving to a different continent andnot giving my phone or address to anyone she might know still causes me a lot of stress when she attempts to send messages through others or sends guilt trips in the mail, this spikes my anxiety a lot and being unable to drink/smoke/cut anymore I turn to nail biting and my hands look like shit.

I'm ashamed to go to a job interview with my hands like this because I work in the design field and I know how shallow it can be and how people can be turned away from a position just from their looks alone in an interview. I mean if I could I would wear nail polish but I don't have the length for it and that'd probably bar me from getting a job harder than having bad nails.

How can I stop eating/biting my nails? I can't go to a therapist anymore since I moved country again, so preferrably some options or solutions that don't involve therapy would be best right now for me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TW: Self Harm, addictions, mentions of emotional abuse)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of a very tough childhood (caused by having a malignant narcissist of a mother and living in a really bad+dangerous place) I turned to self-harm in many ways when I was 13-14 as a way to cope with all the emotions I had to repress and all the anxiety that they and puberty caused, by &amp;quot;many ways&amp;quot; I mean from drinking and smoking to cutting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being a high performance functional alcoholic for years I decided to get psychological help to slow down and try to quit my vices as a way of coping with anxiety, because I was in a really bad place mentally and was considering suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 15+ years of smoking I quit cold turkey and I&amp;#39;m about to hit 1 year clean from nicotine and weed, I also went from 1 bottle of rum/gin every 2 days to 1 beer every 2 days (and sometimes I can go a whole week without a beer). I know it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like much but it&amp;#39;s been a really hard and uphill battle, everytime I smell cigs or see gin I&amp;#39;m tempted to fall back into the easy way of coping and it takes a lot of strength to stay clean and strong (I also haven&amp;#39;t self harmed in almost a year, which is another victory I suppose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I have never managed to stop doing though was biting my nails. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my worst I would chew into the skin itself or use manicure tools to cut myself further, usually causing infections which I hid and treated on my own, because if found out I&amp;#39;d face shame and humilliation from my narcissist parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I&amp;#39;m No Contact with her, but her attempts at boundary stomping despite me blocking her from everything, moving to a different continent andnot giving my phone or address to anyone she might know still causes me a lot of stress when she attempts to send messages through others or sends guilt trips in the mail, this spikes my anxiety a lot and being unable to drink/smoke/cut anymore I turn to nail biting and my hands look like shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ashamed to go to a job interview with my hands like this because I work in the design field and I know how shallow it can be and how people can be turned away from a position just from their looks alone in an interview. I mean if I could I would wear nail polish but I don&amp;#39;t have the length for it and that&amp;#39;d probably bar me from getting a job harder than having bad nails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I stop eating/biting my nails? I can&amp;#39;t go to a therapist anymore since I moved country again, so preferrably some options or solutions that don&amp;#39;t involve therapy would be best right now for me.&lt;/p&gt;

Daughter (gulp) and all my life I’ve had really awful anxiety. Now up until about 18months-3 years  ago anxiety didn’t seem to be a  socially acceptable reason to have my quirks and weird ass coping mechanisms but now it is! I don’t know if it’s the wonder of social media or that so
Many people have this so now
We can openly discuss it but finally people accept that I suffer, and have suffered and have found my ways to cope. As a small child I was told don’t be shy, speak up.. as a teen I was well behaved in school
And when the teacher would say miss(insert name) we haven’t heard you all
Lesson what’s the answer to this unanswerable question and I would get the barb wire throat tear panic can’t breath everyone is laughing at me time stands still
Moment press upon me my soul (eurgh I’m shuddering) as a clumsy young adult I left college after my first  day because I forgot to
Pack Lunch and was so hungry and travel sick from the journey I didn’t know what to do or where to go so I cried alone In the toilet and waited until after lunch to leave.(too socially shy and crippled with anxiety to ask a single question).. luckily as an adult I found
A partner who totally understood and boosted me high enough with confidence and love that I ignore the voices or thoughts. I still suffer ridiculously but I’m honest and tell
People I’m ok I just have my moments, I’ve never forced my daughter into social interactions she’s never wanted, I’ve always listened and waited for her, I never put her down, (even when she’s a pain in the butt) she has anxiety too but it’s normal teen angst but we laugh about it all

On friends occasionally when she can’t face them. “She’s grounded” wink wink lol my friends know that when I can’t go to a party I’m not being rude I just can’t face it that time, not always but sometimes.

Doubting wreck when I
Set out to earn my living.. I just wanted to share. Keep going, keep breathing, keep being you, I made it! So can you. 
Last note I was never offered any drugs or medication to help, don’t feel weak if you want medication to help you cope, the world is hard and cruel but we anxious shrews must stick

I guess I was looking to validate my negative opinions of myself and, well, now I&amp;#39;m straying towards gloating so I guess I have found something to validate my negative opinions of myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was riding high for a few days on the back of these but now I&amp;#39;m starting to falter. It&amp;#39;s strange, like the only two things in life I actually want deep down are also absolutely terrifying. I can&amp;#39;t actually let them go though because that&amp;#39;s like jumping into a well labelled &amp;quot;depression&amp;quot; which is much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

Worried that my dad will find out about that I flunked my welding class, and that my college career is over. Worried about my own mortality.  Having to text my dad, whom I do not get along with. Worried about how I should act around this girl at my work after I went on a date with her last night. Guilt for not texting this other girl much since being intimate with her 9 days ago, and feeling like a total douchebag and someone who used her. Worried that I'll get fired at work because my manager asked me to do a job, but it took too long because customers prevented me from getting it done for two hours. My OCD making me do nonsensical compulsions that can often take 45 minutes. Not to mention the pure-O thoughts I get of people or things that I hate, am afraid of, disgusted by. Getting chastised by my best friend for speaking too loudly while talking about ""the hot girls here"" at a swimming hole when many might have been in earshot. Worried that I'm a horrible cat owner because it's taken me a long time to bond with her, plus I can't afford a cat tower - also I don't play with her much because I prefer cuddling with her instead - *I'm probably neglecting her needs!* Worried that the girl at work I went on a date with 2 nights ago will not text me back, and that she'll ghost me, just like all of the other women that I talk to.

Now, I woke up at 3:30 this morning (for unrelated reasons - my room was too hot) and had to deal with some lovely POCD.

I also have a small face relative to my head, which is a trait that many pedophiles possess. Plus, since being chastised by my friend last night, I found it harder to think of hot girls without thinking about what a douchebag I am, so maybe that's why my brain switched to kids?

It's the 5th one I've had in the last 24 hours. It's like 3:30 AM. I have stuff to do tomorrow. Yet, here I am, trying to breathe calmer, while my heart keeps skipping beats. I'm shaking, my palms are so sweaty the mouse on my laptop doesn't work very good, and I'm crying my eyes out. It keeps coming and going in waves. As soon as I start to think the attack is over, my heart skips another beat and it just starts back up again. 

Long story short, my mom wants to move states to be closer to her best friends and take me with her. I'm 18, but am dependent on my mom because I'm disabled and my SSI paperwork is gonna take months to finalize. I have Cystic Fibrosis, which is a main source of anxiety. But right now, I'm anxious about moving out of state. I've lived in my current state all my life. All of my maternal relatives, and my dad, are here. I have a few good friends here as well. I don't want to leave it all behind. I can visit all I want. The flights are cheap and short, and the drive isn't terribly far (about 7 hours). But, travelling is really difficult for me too, because wherever I go, I have to take all of my medications and heavy medical equipment with me. 

My mom, while she also has anxiety (both sides of my family have genetic anxiety), doesn't understand why I have anxiety. Mom and I couldn't be more different, and she also gets into these moods sometimes where she puts all of her shit on me. We go to the same therapist who is really good at her job, but not even my therapist is having very much luck getting my mom to understand me. I have access to my therapist through text during reasonable hours (obviously 3:44 AM on a Monday morning is not a reasonable hour to wake up my therapist), but I'm riding this wave of anxiety out alone, like I have been for the last several days. 

My mom is really hard to talk to about serious things that are bothering me. She doesn't see how badly this whole out-of-state move could turn out for me. I'm gonna be completely uprooted. Everything in my life is gonna change. I'm used to change, and can adapt to it pretty quickly, but this change is different, and my body seems to know it. During each anxiety attack, I swear I'm about to die. I know, logically, that's not true. But, feelings trump facts during panic attacks, so obviously, I'm gonna jump to the worst possible case.

I'm gonna see my therapist on Wednesday morning, but I have no real outlet from anxiety until then. I know these attacks are gonna keep happening no matter what I do. Medication hasn't worked for me, neither has CBD oil, lavender smell, or petting my dog. When I get anxiety attacks, the only thing that seems to help me survive these things is to pace around, cry it out, and drink lots of water. Eventually, the anxiety attack finally subsides for good, but I never know if it'll go away in 5 minutes or 5 hours. Like I said, the panic attacks work in waves. 

But still, I just hate feeling so alone, and having to ride these increasingly worse and more sudden panic attacks on my own. As the moving date draws closer, my anxiety only gets worse. I also have social anxiety, so talking to people about my problems irl (besides my therapist) is a big No from me. 

I just hate what I'm going through.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the middle of yet another anxiety attack.

All of my friends went and were convincing me to go too. I told them I would come but I didn’t. In my past I’ve been through crippling depression and anxiety attacks. It was horrible and that time could’ve made me kill myself easily. It was at its peak in the beginning year of As level. I remember I would come home every day and just cry.

I’ve been through a lot. Especially with my relationship in the beginning . Me and my bf are almost a year into our relationship now. And believe me when I say this I had changed tremendously as a person and so did he, life has also changed tremendously in a good way and for the most part it’s going the way I wanted it to.

I told him how I was getting flashbacks of the tough times in our relationship and how I remembered I went through a terrible time last year. I was feeling sorry for myself and I was crying cuz it was unbelievable how I made it through that time. He talked me out of it and reminded me to look towards the future not the past and to live in the present moment. 

He literally talked about how we’d get married in a few years haha and how we’d planned to do university together. Well all my worries flew away and he cheered me up a lot. But I still have these painful pangs in my heart...I’m so terrified of going to school and achieving my goals. I think something bought back old memories and I want to avoid living in my past because ik I’ll end up with that depression phase again.

Life has been going amazing this year because I forgot my past and started living in the future and present instead. I don’t want to fall into that same hellhole again. I’m so confused and scared right now. I don’t want all my effort to go to waste. I put so much work into my self development and personal growth. I am proud of who I am rn.

Normally gets worse as the day progresses and interferes heavily with work/motivation/focus. 

Started about 5 months ago when I had a bout of health anxiety and would focus/worry about a certain health topic daily for a couple weeks. A couple weeks later and during a stressful time in my life, this head pressure/pain appeared and has not dissapeared since. From there went through the normal health checks (mri etc.) and they couldnt find the cause with one of the doctors wondering and myself now beleiveing it is stress/anxiety related. I have also experienced black floaty things in my eyes and stomach pain at points in the past months which lead me to believe it is physical symptoms of anxiety. 

This pressure has persisted daily for months now and has continued to damage every facet of my daily life and I'm running out of hope of ever returning to normal as nothing I've tried has seemed to work.

A list of things ive tried:

\-tylenol/pain killers - no effect

\-sinus medicine/steriods - no effect

\-oxygen tank- no effect

\-wellbutrin - currently been taking for a couple months - no effect

\-diet/exercise - lost 20 pounds - small improvement

\-magnesium/vitamin d - just started taking 2 days ago and will be taking daily - nothing yet

\-cbd vape - no effect

\-cbd tincture - just started yesterday and will be taking daily - nothing yet

\-meditation-started yesterday and will be doing daily - nothing yet

Ive tried so much and cant seem to escape it, open to trying anything to get back to normal (open to mushrooms and will be seeing a dr soon to hopefully get on some anxiety meds to see if they help). If anyone has experienced something similar or has some advice for how to get through this I would be so grateful, slowly losing hope that it will ever get better.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting since about 5 months ago I&amp;#39;ve had daily head pressure (primarily on the right and front/top of my head) that feels like someone pushing down on my head or that pressure needs to be released from a spot. Normally gets worse as the day progresses and interferes heavily with work/motivation/focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started about 5 months ago when I had a bout of health anxiety and would focus/worry about a certain health topic daily for a couple weeks. A couple weeks later and during a stressful time in my life, this head pressure/pain appeared and has not dissapeared since. From there went through the normal health checks (mri etc.) and they couldnt find the cause with one of the doctors wondering and myself now beleiveing it is stress/anxiety related. I have also experienced black floaty things in my eyes and stomach pain at points in the past months which lead me to believe it is physical symptoms of anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pressure has persisted daily for months now and has continued to damage every facet of my daily life and I&amp;#39;m running out of hope of ever returning to normal as nothing I&amp;#39;ve tried has seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of things ive tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-tylenol/pain killers - no effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-sinus medicine/steriods - no effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-oxygen tank- no effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-wellbutrin - currently been taking for a couple months - no effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-diet/exercise - lost 20 pounds - small improvement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-magnesium/vitamin d - just started taking 2 days ago and will be taking daily - nothing yet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-cbd vape - no effect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-cbd tincture - just started yesterday and will be taking daily - nothing yet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-meditation-started yesterday and will be doing daily - nothing yet&lt;/p&gt;

I was hoping someone could help me.

I always wake up earlier than necessary and then all the things that I'm anxious about come flooding to me and I can't fall back asleep and sometimes I end up having an anxiety attack.

In addition, I often have these dreams where I am out somewhere, a cottage is a common setting, and I need to get home and I can't. I don't drive IRL so a common theme is I can't get or find my ride. 

Other times it's just stupid things that side track me.

I am currently going through a depressive episode so today actually was so bad I called into work. And I hate that. I have been managing it pretty well but this is one thing I've never been able to combat.

In case it matters I do not take medication for my depression or anxiety but I do take concerta. I didn't take it yesterday as I usually don't on weekends but I haven't noticed this is a trend that triggers it. I also do smoke pot - it often does usually help but I'd love to learn to tackle the issue in another way.

I tend to worry and I get paranoid easily. I'm jumpy and easy to scare. I need to have things planned out letter by letter or I panic and can't think straight. I've never been sure if that was my anxiety or my personality. Well, basically, I've spent so much time avoiding things that were scary, that I've found myself in tight spot.

I want to be the kind of person who can live without being dependent on them.   


You see, this is where my fear of not being taken seriously comes in. I love to create. I think it's the only passion I have. But, I'm bad at it. It's all I want to do. It's all I can see myself doing. I've tried writing and drawing and painting and music and game development and sculpting and I'm terrible at all of it. Nothing took. Nothing felt like it was what I was meant to do, it didn't feel right. Drawing is the only thing I stuck with, because its the one way I was able to connect with others (online). It's gotten to the point that drawing makes up my whole identity, and without it I'd be nothing. I'd have nothing. I don't want to stop drawing, even though I'm not sure I feel joy in it anymore. I want to create for a living. I don't want a desk job or retail or any of that. I'm terrified that's all I'll ever be qualified for, and I'll spend the rest of my life miserable. It's such a childish thing to think, but it genuinely makes me hysterical to think about.

I want to learn, but my fear and anxiety seem to encapsulate and overshadow everything I do. I don't know how to push past it.

Well, I just messaged my boss through our scheduling website saying I'm not coming in tomorrow. I know that sounds shitty, and it is, but it's been a month long road leading to this.
I've been working in a nice Mexican restaurant this past month, it seemed like a great opportunity and it started off fine. I'd work prep in the mornings until 2 or 3 and then head home. Pretty chill even though they are extremely under staffed.
But then came my first Friday prep shift. I worked from 8 AM until 8 PM without a break trying to get everything done by myself. Eventually I did, but I was exhausted, angry, and anxious since I half-assed the last few things to get it to end.
Repeat that for Saturday and the next weekend. I'm starting to get worn down as the hours start to pile up during the week as well as the weekend. I'm being given more and more hours with more and more responsibility since there is no one else. My days are now 12 or 13 hours long with a ten minute break if I'm lucky. With all those hours I only got 6 or 7 hours of sleep a night by the time I got home and got to bed. I'm trying my best, but there is always so much more to be done and no one has time to really help me do it. 
This week I went in every day wanting to cry, and I came close a couple times every day. They'd beg me to work another night shift and I would because I want to help, even though I'm exhausted. It's always ""We need you, otherwise it'll just be (insert name) and me (manager/owner) working the line tonight."" I only told them no once or twice.
Today was my breaking point though. 9 AM to 10 PM, with a 10 minute break in there somewhere. I'd been on the verge of tears all day while I convinced myself to keep going. And when I finally left, I got a ride home from my mom, got in the car and completely broke down. She was sympathetic, but told me she'd never encourage me to quit but I need to do whatever I think is best.
My boyfriend told me I should quit when I got home, and I had to agree even though I could feel my anxiety peaking just thinking about the phone call my boss would give me in the morning. 

In short: 50/60 hour weeks for a month at new job brought out a new level of anxious in me and I quit through a scheduling website message. Stressing the fuck out about what I'm going to wake up to in the morning.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m stressing out hard about this, and my anxiety is eating at my stomach. Any advice would be really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

But now, suddenly I&amp;#39;m on my own. I know I make it sound like she&amp;#39;s dying or something, she isn&amp;#39;t (probably). But she&amp;#39;s still not well. I just want to see her back on her feet again asap, seeing her like this now feels corrosive to my memories and life. This is most likely my anxiety speaking, maybe it&amp;#39;s my ego too.. i dunno. there&amp;#39;s not much &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; for doctors and treatment here so it&amp;#39;s usually harder to overcome conditions like this, but I&amp;#39;ll just have to wait. 2 days ago, when vertigo hit her again all of a sudden, she was really bad. At one point she wouldn&amp;#39;t respond to me talking and didn&amp;#39;t even move for a couple of seconds, I almost passed out from my fear until she responded again. My friend lost his mom to cancer about 2 or 3 months ago, and when I see him he still seems like the old friend I&amp;#39;ve always known, I just can&amp;#39;t possibly imagine how my life would feel if something happened to my mom, it&amp;#39;s so unreal and hard for me to understand people capable of dealing with this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

Negative thoughts bouncing off one another. I feel depressed as fuck coming to work. Even my colleagues are concerned in my serious 180 in demeanour.

Am i being pathetic? i understand work culture, its not always good or positive. Most people are known to dislike management. But this impending disciplinary has completely demolished most of the mental progress ive made.

Last night i couldnt stop crying. I felt a deep sadness and i honestly just longed for a loving hug in my bed. 

I hate being so emotional, i dont mean to be that way. 

I came to work this morning, cried 3 times. I just dont feel good at all here.

I was even thinking of ways to help me cope through this discipline meeting i have scheduled tomorrow.

We live together and we have been together for 5 years. A few days ago I found out about something he did that got me really mad and upset and he didn’t do nothing about it. He knew I was pretty devastated and been spending my entire days thinking about that. 
I have a lot of anxiety and I don’t have many friends, he is my only real friend. 
Last night I finally got him to talk to me. He cried, he said that he can’t do nothing about the way I am feeling because when he sees me crying he can only think about the awful things I did to him in the past. I’m not proud of anything I did, I said him some pretty awful stuff during our relationship and although I did not mean anything of what I’ve said he is still really hurt about it. I’ve had a hard time in the past controlling my feelings, every time I felt upset about anything I was just so mean to him and I told him AWFUL stuff.  
Yesterday I told him that I was tremendously sorry about everything, that I know I was wrong and that I didn’t mean anything of it, but I took responsibility for the things I’ve said. I told him that I love him so much and I am grateful for having him in my life and I don’t want to lose him. I haven’t told him I loved him (or him to me) for so long. He told me he loved me too and that he always will. 
When I asked if he still wants to be with me he said that he can’t answer that question because he just feels so numb. He also said that I need to start being more independent and have a life and let him do his thing without me as well.  
Im going to start therapy this week, I know I have a lot of issues and just the idea of being away from him gets me so upset, I can’t understand simple basic stuff like why does he want to have some coffee with his co workers instead of being with me? I know that’s wrong and I have to work on that. 
The thing is I am so shocked by how he is feeling. I had no idea he was so hurt. I feel devastated for hurting so much the person who always had my back. I’m so scared I’m going to lose him, I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m terrified, I’ve been trying so hard to make him forgive me but I know that takes time and I am just so anxious ALL the time. I don’t know what to do. I can’t think of anything else, I can’t do anything else. 
Im hoping therapy will help but I don’t know if I’m going to be able to improve without him by my side. I don’t want him to leave me but I feel like I fucked up everything. I don’t think he is going to leave me anytime soon but I keep thinking that maybe he will in a few months, or a year or 10 years or 40. I feel so insecure. 
I wasn’t so terrified about everything before I knew how he was feeling. I am just trying my best to make thinks work, to be a better person (for him and for me) but I’m so anxious...  I don’t know what to do. I just wish I could go back in time and take away all the bad I did him. No one deserves that. I wish I had gone to therapy earlier to work on my issues. I feel like my anxiety and fear of being alone ruined what could have been a very good and lasting relationship.

So a little backstory, I'm currently 25, and I've been having anxiety for over half my life, that I know of.  
I was bullied all through school until I permanently dropped out at 16. I've gotten my degree through self-study at around 21, which I guess I'm kind of proud of.  
Either way, around 16 is when I also met my first partner, surprise, bad relationship. Was in it for 4 years.  
He then took his own life 2 years later, but that's a whole different load of guilt and bad stuff.  
Anyhow, two more partners later, of which the most recent one was severely depressed but kind, and I've met another great person. ( It's been rough maintaining a solid relationship with my 'issues', so sadly neither of them worked out.)  
The problem I'm having now is, I find it near impossible to make friends, due to the social anxiety and effectively being cooped up in my apartment, ( I live alone, like.. All alone. I hate it.) and also because gamer friends can be quite inconsistent when it comes to hanging out.  
Not to mention I've got a really bad side with losing my temper, not due to games, but due to people bullying in games, and any such actions. (Flaming, being toxic, etc.)  
Now, I've usually got my great guy that I mentioned, but he's someone who enjoys having time to himself.  
He keeps pushing that aside for my sake, so I'm not getting too much anxiety, but it's really hard on him. Today, he's been out with friends all day and until about 4 pm I hung out with two friends, but once they left.. I tried playing some games on my own, I did some household stuff, I tried watching videos. You know, occupy myself.  


But the anxiety keeps passively building up. So now, when it's almost 10 pm, I'm pretty restless and I feel really uncomfortable.  
And it's in situations like these that my anxiety and bad thoughts can turn it into 'no one cares about me', or more accurately 'no one should care about me, why do they? I really wish they didn't.' and any modicum of 'proof' that they don't makes it so.  


I don't know what to do against this, and I hate what I become when this happens, because I feel trapped, I'm scared, and I start lashing out at the ones that care about me. Which is a number that's dwindled quite significantly recently.  


I feel completely dependent on my new friend, and I don't know how to stop that. It's unhealthy and I can't keep doing that or any chance at a proper relationship will just fail again.  
I really like this guy which has caused my anxiety/fears to amp up significantly, to the point I can't keep a lid on them.  


Also due to a scheduling error I haven't been able to see my therapist since early July, and I won't be able to until mid September. I usually go once every two weeks, and this past month has been VERY stressful. (new part time job, school almost coming up, I'm enrolling because I was doing a lot better before. and my first partners suicide was 13th-14th of august, which still gets me down and feel guilty over)  


I feel like it's also worth mentioning I've been diagnosed with PTSD which is why I lash out horribly, my fight or flight reactions are completely off the rails. I have nightmares several times per week and I often blank out when idle/in a high risk situation.  


So any helpful tips or shared feelings or anything would be greatly appreciated. I want to be better and I need to get control of this, I just don't know how to. I just really hate how I am right now and I don't want to keep going like this. Please help me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I&amp;#39;m actually pretty terrified to even make this post, but here goes I guess.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel completely dependent on my new friend, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop that. It&amp;#39;s unhealthy and I can&amp;#39;t keep doing that or any chance at a proper relationship will just fail again.&lt;br/&gt;
I really like this guy which has caused my anxiety/fears to amp up significantly, to the point I can&amp;#39;t keep a lid on them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also due to a scheduling error I haven&amp;#39;t been able to see my therapist since early July, and I won&amp;#39;t be able to until mid September. I usually go once every two weeks, and this past month has been VERY stressful. (new part time job, school almost coming up, I&amp;#39;m enrolling because I was doing a lot better before. and my first partners suicide was 13th-14th of august, which still gets me down and feel guilty over)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it&amp;#39;s also worth mentioning I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with PTSD which is why I lash out horribly, my fight or flight reactions are completely off the rails. I have nightmares several times per week and I often blank out when idle/in a high risk situation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So any helpful tips or shared feelings or anything would be greatly appreciated. I want to be better and I need to get control of this, I just don&amp;#39;t know how to. I just really hate how I am right now and I don&amp;#39;t want to keep going like this. Please help me.&lt;/p&gt;

Why not? Ok, so when I was a kid whenever I would cry for a good amount of time I would get this sensation in my cheeks. You ever sat on your hands and they fall asleep? That's what it feels like in my cheeks. Usually the crying would have to be triggered by something specific, like loud yelling for long periods of time, or one time I scared my mom and she screamed **real loud.** I went into my bathroom and cried, because it scared me in turn and I felt bad, but after a while the crying didn't stop. It was super intense crying and eventually I started to get that feeling in my cheeks. After a bit longer my right eye scrunched up and I couldn't open it fully, and my fingers on both hands scrunched up as well. My mom came in and calmed me down, and eventually I went back to normal. We just considered it a panic attack, but after some research only one or two of the symptoms applied (hyperventilation and raised heart rate.) Recently though, I had something very similar. I was crying really intensely (church stuff) and I started to get the numbness/tingle in my cheeks. A new thing showed up though. After I was done crying I removed myself and started to hyperventilate and my heart rate increased a lot. It felt like anxiety, because I was afraid I was about to have another one of the ""panic attacks."" I want to know if anyone shares the same symptoms, and if so if they're possibly related to anxiety.

Why not? Ok, so when I was a kid whenever I would cry for a good amount of time I would get this sensation in my cheeks. You ever sat on your hands and they fall asleep? That&amp;#39;s what it feels like in my cheeks. Usually the crying would have to be triggered by something specific, like loud yelling for long periods of time, or one time I scared my mom and she screamed &lt;strong&gt;real loud.&lt;/strong&gt; I went into my bathroom and cried, because it scared me in turn and I felt bad, but after a while the crying didn&amp;#39;t stop. It was super intense crying and eventually I started to get that feeling in my cheeks. After a bit longer my right eye scrunched up and I couldn&amp;#39;t open it fully, and my fingers on both hands scrunched up as well. My mom came in and calmed me down, and eventually I went back to normal. We just considered it a panic attack, but after some research only one or two of the symptoms applied (hyperventilation and raised heart rate.) Recently though, I had something very similar. I was crying really intensely (church stuff) and I started to get the numbness/tingle in my cheeks. A new thing showed up though. After I was done crying I removed myself and started to hyperventilate and my heart rate increased a lot. It felt like anxiety, because I was afraid I was about to have another one of the &amp;quot;panic attacks.&amp;quot; I want to know if anyone shares the same symptoms, and if so if they&amp;#39;re possibly related to anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm 36F, I have an 8yo and I'm a single mum. Not dating, and my parents are my rock. Both myself and my daughter are really close with my parents. We see them, if not daily, every other day.

I've had anxiety over death from as long as I can remember. When I was an early teenager, it would worsen when I was hormonal. And it probably still does. I remember asking my mum to promise me to meet me on the brightest star when we died so we would be together again. 

It's not just my death I am anxious about, it's losing either one of my parents or my daughter. I have a sister that lives away and I love her a lot but the fear doesn't include her. Of course I'd be devastated if something was to happen to her but I feel as though my life would end if something happened to either one of my parents or my daughter.

It affects me in ways where if I was to put my daughter on the bus instead of driving her to school, then I think that if the bus was to crash and she was to die then it would be my fault because I didn't drive her.

I don't know if it's because I'm single and I don't have that spousal support if something was to happen. 

Today seems to be a bad day. After I drove my daughter to school I really had to try and move my mind to other thoughts. It was hard. I ended up telling myself that if something was to happen, I would survive as other people have. I cried driving home. I thought maybe it's because I'm tired, I haven't been sleeping well since I had an operation just over a week ago, I napped when I got home and now I am in tears again so I decided to write this post.

I have a doctors appointment later today about something else but I will speak to him about being referred to a counsellor. But I am wondering if anyone else has these fears and anxiety and how you deal with it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time poster in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

Can never fall asleep without sleep medicine because my anxiety keeps me awake and crying. I went to a cardiologist in June.

I want to go back to life before that panic attack and live like a normal college student. Can you drink with regurgitation? I could have went awhile without learning about my regurgitation too. 

I sleep with the lights on and always FaceTime someone before I go to sleep in case something happens. I’m sorry if this posts all in all sounds stupid.

My panic attacks have stopped completely but there has obviously been some pros and cons. 

Pros: No panic attacks, sleeping much better, anxiety is much more in control, i can live in the moment ( a bit of a con because it has impacted my memory), all my friends and family know and no one has said i have acted any differently which is good i am ""myself"" on the outside at least, i am no longer at the mercy of a racing mind telling me im going crazy. My dreams have been vivid - i was also a dreamer but this is different, its like im watching a movie. Sex drive is normal, appetite is normal, no longer drowsy and have no headaches.

Cons in first 2 weeks: first 3 days my panic/anxiety was way worse, and i was having suicidal thoughts which were scary and intense, fucked up. Sex drive was down to a pulp, appetite was way down, drowsy, headaches. 

Cons after first 2 weeks: Emotional bluntness, i loved music and now it does nothing for me, my feelings and emotions have seem to be bounded to a very tight spectrum, not too high not too low, which i dont really like. Sometimes my memory is shot, especially short term, my mind seems a bit cloudy and sometimes its hard to think. 

Lastly, i have noticed  (even about 3 weeks before the meds while i was at my most unstable), i couldnt enjoy some simple things in life, like going to the gym or having a cigarette, i basically stopped smoking which is a good thing, but like after gym i still havent gotten a natural high, i thought the medication might return this but it hasnt, any idea whats going on? I feel like im living a dull life, its livable for now... but i know i cant live like this for ever.

Are there any tactics you have for how to teach oneself how to accomplish that 'pause' between trigger and response, so that I can eventually learn how to GIVE myself that second or two to think before just responding?

My school currently ranks in the Top 10 for party schools, yet I don’t plan on living like a bachelor and I’ve always made loyalty my number one priority.

39/male with history of insomnia, anxiety, bipolar 2. Tried Lunesta for sleep, but it never worked great and lost effectiveness over time. Currently taking Temazepam 22.5mg and Clonidine 0.2mg for sleep, but it has quickly started losing effectiveness. I meditate to help fall asleep. I take several other medications. 

My Insomnia is mostly centered around being physically restless and mentally aroused and/or racing thoughts usually centered on worrying about past/present/future; and comes in the form of both difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. When I wake, my mind is immediately switched on full blast, often worried over something or focused on negativity, and usually with some ear worm song stuck on repeat in my head (this is constant for me, all day, all night, everyday).  

Things were going really well for a month or so, but the last week my sleep has dropped way off and I’m super tense all the time. I tend to be sensitive to meds, and I can’t afford to miss my alarm and be late for work (new job) so I’m terrified of med changes that might leave me unable to get up or function the next day. But I can feel my body and mind struggling from the lack of sleep, and need to find a solution. 

What worked for you? Thank you for your input and sharing!


More info:

I (39m) have an 8 year history of insomnia that started when work stress increased a bunch. Used to smoke pot to help get to and stay asleep for a solid 8-9 hours, but it stopped working a couple years ago. 

Took Lunesta for about 8-9 months, first 1mg then 2 then 3mg, until it wasn’t helping me get more than 2-3 hours a night. Had a sleep study and they determined my insomnia was likely anxiety related and suggested I talk to my psych about removing the Lunesta and starting something more anxiety focused. 

So that’s what I did and she started me on Temazepam 7.5mg, then 15, then 22.5mg after the hours at 15mg dropped from 6 to 4. I was good for a month or two and was getting 7 hours for a while, but I slowly started having more and more difficulty falling asleep, and sleeping less and less hours. Now I’m down to about 3-4 hours a night again, and it’s leaving me almost totally useless everyday, with no energy and cranky. 

I am jittery and anxious everyday, sometimes paranoid. Recent lab work, including a metabolic panel, shows normal. My body is so tense all the time that some of my muscles tend to be constantly flexed, which has lead to pain developing in various areas, and an inability to relax. It’s like i can lay in bed, and my whole body is stiff and rigid, like I’m tensed up in anticipation of a fight - but all the time. I’ve lost over 20 pounds in 2 months without trying, no exercise, seemingly because I’m just always so friggin tense. My general doc gave me a clean bill of health just a couple weeks ago. 

Looking for solutions. I already use guided meditation to help me fall asleep. I also have some other mental health problems and take other meds, please see below:

Other info:
- Diagnosed bipolar 2, treatment resistant
- Racing thoughts and irritability are my norm, but I try hard to be mindful, present and positive. 
- Very prone to depression
- I’ve dabbled with CBD, and have found it to help, but 25mg sublingual (nuleaf) in combo with the other meds only nets me 4-6 hours of sleep (4-5 lately), and If I forget to take it, I only get maybe 3 hours at best. 

Current Meds (I’ve taken many different ones):

Night —
- Temazepam 22.5mg for sleep
- Clonidine 0.2mg (anti-hypertensive) to help me relax before bed
- Lithium 900mg to help curb hypomania
- Prazosin 2mg to reduce intense nightmares (the wake up at 2am every night, screaming bloody murder, leaving you shaking like a leaf for 30 minutes kind of nightmares)
- Melatonin 3mg
- Vit C

Day —
- Wellbutrin/bupropion 150mg 2x/day for depression. This definitely increases my anxiety and is very activating, but after 4 years of different meds to reduce depression, this is the only one that has made a difference. 
- Buspirone/Buspar 5mg 3x/day for anxiety, which I started after the Wellbutrin made me so very anxious
- Adderall 20mg morning, 10 or 20mg early afternoon (without it I’m a space cadet)
- Testosterone Cypionate 0.40mg 200mg/ml injection 1x/week (I have very low natural levels, 120-200 where normal is 300-900ish depending on age and individuals)
- Also take vitamins including a super-B complex and D3","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr

I'm in my late 20's and suffering from anxiety and depression. Looking back, I first remember experiencing issues with anxiety and depression in my early teens. In the time/place I grew up in, mental health treatment was frowned upon. You were either seen by the community as being weak or completely insane for seeking medical treatment for mental illness. It was regarded as something that you would just grow out of.

After graduating high school, it seems that my mental situation began to gradually worsen. I dropped out of college and started back several times due to my symptoms. I would either become too anxious due to large class sizes or assume that everyone despised me just for being there. I often skipped classes just because of my overwhelming sense of anxiousness. Eventually I managed to graduate with a bachelor's degree only a few years ago.

In my mid 20's my mental situation significantly worsened after moving to a larger city. I began lashing out at those closest to me because my symptoms had become overwhelming. My short but miserable marriage collapsed mostly due to my frequent inability to function in social situations. I was often rude and distant from others because I just wanted to be left alone. If I wasn't feeling anxious or depressed, I didn't feel anything at all.

Things improved after my divorce. I felt happy for the first time in years. I found a decently paying job and started a new relationship. However, this year I feel that I am starting to struggle again. I feel that I am heading back into the same situation as the paragraph above. My mind constantly feels like it is about to tear itself apart. I'm stressed over anything and everything. I've been getting more and more distant from my girlfriend. I've considered leaving many times since I don't want to drag her down in my misery. It's just not fair for her. I have had no past trauma that should cause me to feel this way.

As of last week, I've started going to therapy. I'm hopeful that therapy along with medication will help me to live a normal life. If it doesn't, I don't know what other options I have. I constantly have the feeling that I would like to entirely leave this life behind and start over somewhere else.

A few weeks into the year, I began making great strides in coping with my anxiety, as well as lessening symptoms.  Something terrible happened when I got a bit complacent, but no one was hurt.  I realized that my alcoholism was an issue in many aspects and began seeking treatment for it.  Now I'm in recovery and my panic attacks have been steadily improving in a two steps forward, one step back type of way.  But I'm still moving forward, so it's progress nonetheless.

The alcohol accident happened in February and my court case was pushed back until August 20th (this coming Tuesday) so that my therapists could really paint a full picture of why I was drinking like I was and how far I've come since then.  I've come a long, long way.  I've been *so* anxious and stressed about returning to court that I was fired for having a panic attack at work (I know, no use mentioning the legal routes I could take, my lawyer for my current case has already filled me in), but I still have chosen to keep moving forward and not to drink.  It's taken a lot of effort, but it is honestly amazing to accept how I'm feeling and understand that using would make things worse.

To sum it up:  Am I still anxious?  Sure.  There are many things I need to learn and many other things I need to unlearn.  But these things that have happened are things that I told my new/current therapist in January that if they happened, I absolutely could not handle it.  I am anxious and that is understandable.  But I'm handling this anxiety much better than I ever would have thought, especially to be six months into consistent treatment.  This is actually a great demonstration of how much improvement I've made.  I told my parents this over the phone a few minutes ago and they said that they were thinking the same thing, but didn't want to point it out to me and make me overthink (upvote for parents who get it!).

I hope this was able to help someone.  Things can be looking down for you or just in a rough spot, but not everything is horrible, although it likely feels that way.  You're dealing with it and coping with it.  You're managing something unseen that if any non-anxious person you can think of was to suddenly have to deal with for even a few hours, they might break.   It might not seem like a useful skill, but consider this:  How did you feel after reading what I've said?  Now you can go make someone feel like that yourself because of your unique and trying experiences.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve seen my recent posts, you know that I&amp;#39;m dealing with more panic attacks and anxiety symptoms now than I have since the beginning of this year.  A few weeks into the year, I began making great strides in coping with my anxiety, as well as lessening symptoms.  Something terrible happened when I got a bit complacent, but no one was hurt.  I realized that my alcoholism was an issue in many aspects and began seeking treatment for it.  Now I&amp;#39;m in recovery and my panic attacks have been steadily improving in a two steps forward, one step back type of way.  But I&amp;#39;m still moving forward, so it&amp;#39;s progress nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alcohol accident happened in February and my court case was pushed back until August 20th (this coming Tuesday) so that my therapists could really paint a full picture of why I was drinking like I was and how far I&amp;#39;ve come since then.  I&amp;#39;ve come a long, long way.  I&amp;#39;ve been &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; anxious and stressed about returning to court that I was fired for having a panic attack at work (I know, no use mentioning the legal routes I could take, my lawyer for my current case has already filled me in), but I still have chosen to keep moving forward and not to drink.  It&amp;#39;s taken a lot of effort, but it is honestly amazing to accept how I&amp;#39;m feeling and understand that using would make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up:  Am I still anxious?  Sure.  There are many things I need to learn and many other things I need to unlearn.  But these things that have happened are things that I told my new/current therapist in January that if they happened, I absolutely could not handle it.  I am anxious and that is understandable.  But I&amp;#39;m handling this anxiety much better than I ever would have thought, especially to be six months into consistent treatment.  This is actually a great demonstration of how much improvement I&amp;#39;ve made.  I told my parents this over the phone a few minutes ago and they said that they were thinking the same thing, but didn&amp;#39;t want to point it out to me and make me overthink (upvote for parents who get it!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this was able to help someone.  Things can be looking down for you or just in a rough spot, but not everything is horrible, although it likely feels that way.  You&amp;#39;re dealing with it and coping with it.  You&amp;#39;re managing something unseen that if any non-anxious person you can think of was to suddenly have to deal with for even a few hours, they might break.   It might not seem like a useful skill, but consider this:  How did you feel after reading what I&amp;#39;ve said?  Now you can go make someone feel like that yourself because of your unique and trying experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

For a few years now I've been experiencing a lot of the physical symptoms of anxiety, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety, but recently my symptoms have been lasting way longer than ever before. I was wondering if anyone has experienced this and if this is a ""normal"" part of anxiety or if I should see a doctor or something.

To go into more depth - the specific physical symptoms I feel include racing heart, feeling short of breath/like I can't get in enough oxygen even with deep breathing, shaking, and physically feeling very weak. Sometimes a stomach ache/mild nausea too. It's very difficult to eat, walk around, breathe, etc when I feel like this.

Sometimes it even carries into the next day.

Is it normal to feel like this with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety? Has anyone else felt this and found some way to relieve it?

Problem was that I was miserable and not only that but every morning on the way to school I was nervous and outright scared at the prospect of having to meet new people and be friends with them. The first year was unbearably bad, I was extremely self-aware about my appearance, my clothes, the way I was walking, the way I was speaking - almost everything. Up until then I always knew I was a bit of an oddball and a shy guy but at least I managed to have a small group of friends way back from elementary school that I am still in contact with even to this day. But as I said I was thrown into the deep end when I was pressured by my parents to switch to an 'elite' highschool where I had to take the initiative in my hands and talk to people in the hopes of forming meaningful relationships or at least having a couple of people to chat with so I can survive the next 5 years. I had one real friend from there and a couple of guys who I had the on and off chat with. Apart from my only friend there I was hanging out with two other boys and even though I was the butt of the joke for most of the time and was even bullied by them some days, I had to deal with it or face almost total isolation - there were four guys in our class two of them were the 'friends' that bullied me, one was my only real and sincere friend from there and there was another kid that was in some ways like me but it appears he was comfortable with being alone. There were 15 girls and I couldn't dare to speak to them unless they initiated the conversation first - I am even more anxious and awkward with women.

Things were pretty awful for me but it was starting to get a bit more tolerable until one of the guys who I hung out with started bullying me more severely. The guy probably had issues or was a closeted homosexual - he kept calling me and other people 'gay' all the while he was groping us. This sexual harassment was thinly veiled behind him just joking and not doing it 'seriously'. The whole class was at times agitated and furious with him about his antics which not only involved groping and sexually harassing people but also insulting them and I am not talking about simple kindergarten level insults like - 'you're stupid' and 'you're ugly', he knew how to put people down by targeting their insecurities such as calling me a weird, strange and asocial. But nobody except me really despised or hated him for his actions - he was the class clown and people laughed at his bullying as long as they weren't on the receiving end. It was an incredibly toxic atmosphere that definitely didn't help my shy and withdrawn self at all. I could go on and on about the bully but I will cut this short - I snapped one time and retaliated to his verbal abuse with brute force, I beat him up during class. After this accident some people seemed to be slightly scared of me and thought I have anger issues. Strangely enough we made up with this bully and continued communicating until he started bullying me again and the same thing happened....two times. Of course there were people who silently agreed with me and some of them even tried defending me but it was all in vain - after two other cases where I had reacted violently to his abuse I cemented my position as a mentally unstable weirdo in their eyes, I've heard a girl said that I was poised to become a murderer or something like that. All of this started negatively impacting my academical performance - I just didn't care. Even though I aced my first year despite it being probably the worst year of my life, I was hovering around Bs the next two years and while those were still decent marks, I knew I could and should've done better if I wasn't more concerned about whether people would laugh at me or whether the bully would make me snap again at school.

During my last year I didn't get into any sort of confrontation with the bully until a couple of girls painted some graffiti in the class room and they were made to repaint the walls. I felt like this wasn't my problem and that the people who painted them should scrub the graffiti themselves. The fact that the girls who did this were mostly the ones who ridiculed me the most and the ones who even shot a video of me getting bullied which they laughed at and sent to other people, didn't help me get more motivated to repaint the walls. My friend and I refused doing this when it was talked about, strangely enough the bully and his buddy agreed with our stance...On the next day I saw both of them being all giddy and running with buckets of paint and brushes. Only me and my bud stayed true to our word, the paint job was being done at school hours so my friend stayed over at other classes since he had a lot of friends from the other classes, while I was made to stay outside for three hours in a cold November month. After this debacle I was publically scolded by a part of my class that told me I was in their class only on paper and that I should've helped the same people who abused me. I had a spat with the bully some time after this, I didn't assault him or something but I did appear to offend him severely - I told him that he probably has issues back at home and his parents either don't give him enough attention or his daddy molested him so that could be why he sexually harasses people and seeks attention by being the class clown. He was furious with me like never before. That's why one day when I was going back home from school he approached me with a friend of his and threatened to beat me up and find where I live if I didn't meet them at a nearby cafe. This lovely proposal of his was accompanied by a two hour long discussion where he essentially presented himself as a victim all the while his friend slapped me from time to time. This was the last straw - I left the school and I was immensely content with that since I was back in my old neighbourhood school where I had my friends - life was good. Shortly after I left though I kept having dreams how I was assaulting the bullies from the old school with some of them being pretty graphic - breaking their limbs, noses etc. I also had dreams in which I was just still there, also had dreams about my crush from the said school and so on.

The problem is that almost three years later those dreams have returned and I can't stop thinking about my old school, the people there, the times I embarassed myself severely, the times I got into fights, the times my crush smiled at me, the times I felt accomplished, the times I had hilarious moments with my friend there and so on. Whenever I think about this stuff I get nervous and even slightly sweat, if I had a dream about my old school last night I spend the next couple of days overthinking. The thoughts are mostly how things could've been different and how I probably ruined my future by ditching a good school just so I could be more comfortable socially. My old crush has also been getting reignited as of late, I really liked her not only because she was nice, smart and cute but because she was one of the few people who were nice to me, when she told me that I was a 'good person' several times in the span of two minutes I felt that and it made me feel warm inside, especially since it was a month after I beat up the bully for the first time and some people thought I was a psycho. Now looking back at those days, losing sleep, getting anxious and fidgety all over again I wonder - was I a good person really?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to be in one of the top highschools in my country and I aced most of my classes there.

The fact that the girls who did this were mostly the ones who ridiculed me the most and the ones who even shot a video of me getting bullied which they laughed at and sent to other people, didn&amp;#39;t help me get more motivated to repaint the walls. My friend and I refused doing this when it was talked about, strangely enough the bully and his buddy agreed with our stance...On the next day I saw both of them being all giddy and running with buckets of paint and brushes. Only me and my bud stayed true to our word, the paint job was being done at school hours so my friend stayed over at other classes since he had a lot of friends from the other classes, while I was made to stay outside for three hours in a cold November month. After this debacle I was publically scolded by a part of my class that told me I was in their class only on paper and that I should&amp;#39;ve helped the same people who abused me. I had a spat with the bully some time after this, I didn&amp;#39;t assault him or something but I did appear to offend him severely - I told him that he probably has issues back at home and his parents either don&amp;#39;t give him enough attention or his daddy molested him so that could be why he sexually harasses people and seeks attention by being the class clown. He was furious with me like never before. That&amp;#39;s why one day when I was going back home from school he approached me with a friend of his and threatened to beat me up and find where I live if I didn&amp;#39;t meet them at a nearby cafe. This lovely proposal of his was accompanied by a two hour long discussion where he essentially presented himself as a victim all the while his friend slapped me from time to time. This was the last straw - I left the school and I was immensely content with that since I was back in my old neighbourhood school where I had my friends - life was good. Shortly after I left though I kept having dreams how I was assaulting the bullies from the old school with some of them being pretty graphic - breaking their limbs, noses etc. I also had dreams in which I was just still there, also had dreams about my crush from the said school and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that almost three years later those dreams have returned and I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about my old school, the people there, the times I embarassed myself severely, the times I got into fights, the times my crush smiled at me, the times I felt accomplished, the times I had hilarious moments with my friend there and so on. Whenever I think about this stuff I get nervous and even slightly sweat, if I had a dream about my old school last night I spend the next couple of days overthinking. The thoughts are mostly how things could&amp;#39;ve been different and how I probably ruined my future by ditching a good school just so I could be more comfortable socially. My old crush has also been getting reignited as of late, I really liked her not only because she was nice, smart and cute but because she was one of the few people who were nice to me, when she told me that I was a &amp;#39;good person&amp;#39; several times in the span of two minutes I felt that and it made me feel warm inside, especially since it was a month after I beat up the bully for the first time and some people thought I was a psycho. Now looking back at those days, losing sleep, getting anxious and fidgety all over again I wonder - was I a good person really?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve lost a lot of friends in the past, either because I didn’t do things right back then or because they made me unhappy. I blame myself for everything that ever went wrong in my friendships, even though I know what they did wrong too.

He tells me he loves me and we act cute together, but I just still have that horrible gut feeling that something isn’t right and that he secretly holds something against me, even though he’s told me I’ve done nothing wrong.

I feel like just me existing is wrong and my paranoia is taking over my life. I feel scared and vulnerable around everyone because of how easy it is for them to tear me apart and damage me beyond repair. Have I just had bad luck or am I genuinely a bad person?

First off, I’m happy this subreddit exists. I have been having a terrible time for the last 6 months, and it’s all new to me. I’ve been on this subreddit without posting during that time, and reading some of your responses to other posts has helped me. But lately everything has been getting worse, so it’s time for me to post.

I had my first panic attack 6 months ago while I was playing a PC game. Something I’ve done a lot of since I was 12. I had every symptom of a heart attack, including the left arm pain, so I went to the ER. 3 hours later, everything was normal, EKG and everything else.

Fast forward 2 months, and a underlying disease  I have called (ITP) showed it’s ugly face,  Basically my immune system thinks blood platelets are bad, so it kills them, and I need to get plasma transfusions. I was hospitalized for 3 days. In the past (it happened one other time when I was 15) I have quickly recovered from this, but this time I have 2 children; and I’m a full time working attorney. I am pretty sure this is where everything started. 

After this an anxiety got a bit worse, this underlying anxiety following me around, I was diagnosed with IBS, my sleep got worse, I’ve gained and lost weight back and fourth 

However, things got way worse 20 days ago when I started citalopram. I took 10mg for 7 days and have been taking 20mg for the other 13.

Now I think I am having a heart attack everyday. I cannot get this fear that I am dying out of my head. Most of my day is spent with chest pain, from the moment I wake up, until the moment I take enough Ativan to make it stop.  Every pain I feel in my arms or chest instantly triggers me. I am dizzy, exhausted a lot of the time, and just plan old scared my children whom I love dearly aren’t going to have a Dad. 

The weirdest part of me is that I can feel my heart beating whenever I lay down. It’s almost like I can feel it in my entire body. 

I was hoping some of you could share your thoughts and experiences  with any of these symptoms and the usage of citalopram. It would be greatly appreciated. 

I never understood anxiety until this all happened to me, and I am deeply sorry and saddened some of you feel the same thing. One day of this Is harder than undergrad, law school, and the bar exam combined. Any responses I get will be paid forward in other posts where people need help.

More than anything, I think I need to know that I'm not the only one who feels this, too. Some backstory, I have ADHD and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). 

I don't know if it's a fear of abandonment, or something to do with rejection sensitive dysphoria. But I get overwhelmingly anxious if ""I'm not kept in the loop."" 

I think the best way I can describe it is with a couple of examples, so bare with me. 

My brother was visiting a month ago from across the country. We were all planning on going to the beach one day. The night before, my brother made a big deal about being up early so we could get there before the crowds. (He did so jokingly, assuming like all millennials, I slept in). But knowing my family, we'd be getting up and going before ten in the morning. 

The morning of, my boyfriend and I get ready. I text my dad about when we are leaving and start getting anxious as the hours go by. I here from him by noon, saying they got in late and it was going to be a few hours. Not knowing what ""a few hours meant,"" I spent the next two pacing around and trying to occupy myself while my boyfriend tried to keep me calm. Unfortunately, because of how late we ended up going, I wasn't in a great mood and didn't end up enjoying myself like I wish I had. 

The other example is my boyfriend is bad at leaving. He'll go out for a drink with a coworker after work, saying he only expects to be out for a couple of hours. Hours and hours go by, and I don't here from him and I get anxious. 

Other things, like plans getting cancelled, can set me off, too. Especially if I've already put in the energy to get ready. It just *bums* me out. 

And then I feel guilty. My dad only gets to see my brother a couple times a year. Of course it would be silly of me to be upset because they were out having a good time. The same goes for my boyfriend. I want him to go out and have a good time with friends. Even when plans get cancelled, it's usually understandable. It's not like I've never backed out of plans because something came up or I just wasn't feeling well. 

So, I have this anxiety that unfortunately, gets directed a lot at my boyfriend. Today he's been out for friends and said he would be home by dinner -- and it's going to be a bit later than that. I got frustrated and upset, and we bickered over text a little. I was able to take a step back and be aware, and apologize. But now I feel so guilty. I feel like I ruin his nights out and that's not fair to anyone. 

Does anyone else struggle with this? Have you found good ways to cope?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need some advice. More than anything, I think I need to know that I&amp;#39;m not the only one who feels this, too. Some backstory, I have ADHD and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a fear of abandonment, or something to do with rejection sensitive dysphoria. But I get overwhelmingly anxious if &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not kept in the loop.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best way I can describe it is with a couple of examples, so bare with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother was visiting a month ago from across the country. We were all planning on going to the beach one day. The night before, my brother made a big deal about being up early so we could get there before the crowds. (He did so jokingly, assuming like all millennials, I slept in). But knowing my family, we&amp;#39;d be getting up and going before ten in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning of, my boyfriend and I get ready. I text my dad about when we are leaving and start getting anxious as the hours go by. I here from him by noon, saying they got in late and it was going to be a few hours. Not knowing what &amp;quot;a few hours meant,&amp;quot; I spent the next two pacing around and trying to occupy myself while my boyfriend tried to keep me calm. Unfortunately, because of how late we ended up going, I wasn&amp;#39;t in a great mood and didn&amp;#39;t end up enjoying myself like I wish I had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other example is my boyfriend is bad at leaving. He&amp;#39;ll go out for a drink with a coworker after work, saying he only expects to be out for a couple of hours. Hours and hours go by, and I don&amp;#39;t here from him and I get anxious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things, like plans getting cancelled, can set me off, too. Especially if I&amp;#39;ve already put in the energy to get ready. It just &lt;em&gt;bums&lt;/em&gt; me out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I feel guilty. My dad only gets to see my brother a couple times a year. Of course it would be silly of me to be upset because they were out having a good time. The same goes for my boyfriend. I want him to go out and have a good time with friends. Even when plans get cancelled, it&amp;#39;s usually understandable. It&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;ve never backed out of plans because something came up or I just wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have this anxiety that unfortunately, gets directed a lot at my boyfriend. Today he&amp;#39;s been out for friends and said he would be home by dinner -- and it&amp;#39;s going to be a bit later than that. I got frustrated and upset, and we bickered over text a little.

For a little bit of context I have been stressed the whole day (as I have been for a month). I got to sleep after a stressful day and had a pleasant dream, only for it to be ruined by anxiety waking me up and telling me that I just saw the afterlife and would die. Almost like it was ""too peaceful"". My chest and heart have been having pain for the whole day, but eventually I had to go to Sam's club to pick up my new glasses prescription.

I was already feeling my chest getting really hot before I even walked into the store, but I told myself ""this will just be quick, no trouble at all"". Well turns out the eye care center was closed even though their website said they were open. My chest pain started getting really bad and burning like hell. My heart keeps getting stabbing pains. I keep getting extremely dissociated. It felt like I was going to die or pass out. I'm at home now and still not recovered. 

I just can't be convinced that anxiety and stress is solely responsible for all of this. I'm always so fucking terrified that my heart is going to stop, because my brain has me firmly convinced that I am developing a heart problem. I know what I've been told countless times, I can't die from this, it is all because of anxiety, and it will pass. But it feels almost impossible to believe that. I'm totally crushed, humiliated, and scared. And I'm trying my best not to lose hope.

I'm going to the doctor for a physical at some point soon just to have my heart looked at and other things. I don't know why this has to happen to me. I must have done something really stupid and unknowingly damaged my life permanantely. Anyways thanks for reading my long rant.

My life has rapidly changed the past few months and I’m feeling overwhelmed and stressed at the moment.

Now that I am 18, I’m moving in with my father and while I’m extremely excited for what the future holds, the unknown can be terrifying. My friends are going off to college and I’m leaving to start my own life anew and I’m worried that I’m going to end up alone soon. I know in my head that change is a part of life and it’s normal, but it doesn’t make it any easier. I’m worried that if I lose contact with my old friends I won’t be able to make new ones. I really truly love my friends and can easily call them family, but distance can make friendships hard. I’m taking a gap year in between to try to get myself set up in my new home before diving into college, and I’m hoping I can make some new friends in that time. Honestly this has probably happened to millions of people before me and will happen to many after me, and I know it’s not a unique situation. I’m just really really worried. Does anyone have any advice on this?

Now that I am 18, I’m moving in with my father and while I’m extremely excited for what the future holds, the unknown can be terrifying. My friends are going off to college and I’m leaving to start my own life anew and I’m worried that I’m going to end up alone soon. I know in my head that change is a part of life and it’s normal, but it doesn’t make it any easier. I’m worried that if I lose contact with my old friends I won’t be able to make new ones. I really truly love my friends and can easily call them family, but distance can make friendships hard. I’m taking a gap year in between to try to get myself set up in my new home before diving into college, and I’m hoping I can make some new friends in that time. Honestly this has probably happened to millions of people before me and will happen to many after me, and I know it’s not a unique situation. I’m just really really worried. Does anyone have any advice on this? Thanks again for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I'm nervous that she was the only good therapist for me despite having high anxiety. Or that I will never find a good therapist because of my anxious-avoidant nature. If you want more detail, read below. 

So a little context while I'm still able to keep my anxiety at a doable, yet uncomfortable, level. I've been a long-term sufferer of anxiety (having recently for the second time being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and keeping to what I was diagnosed at age 12, which is a pretty bad case of panic disorder). I was raised by a narcissistic dad and what I'd promptly describe as an evil step mom. My mom has unhealthy habits and severe codependency. She experienced a lot of abuse growing up. Shit cards, right? Well it gets worse, for me that is. Through years of constant emotional and mental abuse, I found a lot of comfort with other people (friends). Unfortunately, that turned unhealthy for all parties and collapsed. What I'm saying is that I am capable of making connections, but I'm incredibly picky. Once someone talks to me on a daily or we find ourselves being 'friends', I'm out. My anxiety increases. I start knit picking what this person does or says. I amplify uncomfortable situations or future situations. And all around stop trusting my own judgement. Panic kicks in **FAST** and I'm left crippled by constant attacks and fearful thoughts. Ultimately, I break things off with the person in a quick swoop as probable days have passed where I have not slept or eaten. This 'friend' cycle I've noticed in therapy, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've mostly had talk therapists in my life. I had no idea there were different types. So recently I've tried CBT therapy and I'd say its probably the best therapy type I've ever experienced. **Unfortunately** I have an issue with people. Getting close to people. Not letting their certain quirks distract me. Making judgements on *if this person is someone I want to get close to*. I've noticed my anxiety is kicking in so this might get ramble-y. I can talk about my problems, cry in front of people. No problemo. Some therapists I've been intimidated by. Thinking, ""Oh man I'm so weird. I'm so fucked. What if they don't understand."" And that leads into me trying to be as professional as possible infront of them. And with them, I try to keep eye contact to be nice. I can talk about things and be completely normal in social situations, but breaking that down so I can actually be comfortable with what I'm saying and respect what they're saying is hard. Same goes with people I meet out in the town. On the other side, I get incredibly uncomfortable with people who are overly quirky, clingy, and compliment me far too much. It's like they put me on this high platform and admire me. No thanks. This second example, as in this type of therapist, has really bothered me. It has been really digging at me and triggered a whole 3 day panic attack episode (thank god the ER gave me some sweet sweet meds), is that its hard for me to justify not talking to or seeing someone who is genuine and nice and has done everything to make me okay. Maybe they say something off or something just doesn't sit right. Maybe its my anxiety acting up. Maybe they're getting too close to me too fast? This therapist is silly, quirky, and different. Which is pretty cool and not something I can criticize. But for me, it wasn't a perfect fit. Maybe I'm too... picky. Really maybe I am. 

It sucks. Even from day one, she seemed to really understand and know what I was talking about. I didn't even have to finish sentences and she hits it *right* on the nail. I've never had a therapist like that. I'm a bit off myself. My jokes are out of knowhere, so I'm a hypocrite, probably. But her jokes and the way she had seen the world as ""creative, weird people vs. the NORMALS**""** just didn't sit right with me. And her jokes and ideas of what I'm like were off. As an example (and I am a creative artist): ""OH I could just see you trying different mediums. LIke I could see you painting a picture with different colored snot!"" Maybe funny and comforting to some, but just didn't jive with me. And please don't get me wrong. She was an amazing therapist and a very sweet lady. I don't judge her humor type as something **bad,** just something that made me uncomfortable, personally. But as self-doubt and having immediate issues **now,** I worried myself silly. ""wow she's such a good therapist! She really understands my anxiety and even sheds light on my fearful thinking. Really validating and loves how creative I can be. A genuine person. Genuinely nice and I can *finally* be comfortable being myself. Eye contact and connection and all."" So, for me this was hard to justify why I should stop going to her. My mind: *why do you want to hurt another person and hurt your progress? Isn't this just your cycle of breaking off good people? What is wrong with you. Stop having anxiety about something as trivial as humor.* But, really, humor is important. I want to respect my therapist. Doesn't mean I hate her and doesn't mean she's a bad therapist. No, me questioning if I should still be going *is because she is such a good therapist.* I believe if we were in any other situation aside form therapy, I'd talk to her. I'd work with her. But perhaps the person I need in therapy is something more down to earth and less silly. I love wit and I love cussing. Best environments I've been in have just been an onslaught of ridiculous, mostly immature humor. Sadly my real issue of the night is the last part of this post. I'm scared I'll search indefinitely for the right therapist and that I've made a mistake by not going back to my last therapist. She even had an after office hours session with me yesterday. People are just so god damn nice to me, it hurts. I'm just panicking so much on how to even get the right therapist and if that even exists. I want to be comfortable, but I also don't want to be subjected to silly humor. Or anything that just doesn't jive with me. I also believe our sessions moved far too fast for me to become comfortable with her and her quirks. Only 3 sessions. I can't deny I had a connection with her and I liked that.. I want a connection with someone. Something just felt off. Maybe I'm far too picky.  

I'm not going back to her regardless.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I have a past of childhood trauma.

Do I seek meds or counseling or both?

&amp;nbsp;


Symptoms/state:

&amp;nbsp;
I was fine for a long time, but since making a move across the country from a place I had lived in for 18 years, I started experiencing anxiety I had previously experienced in teenage years because of traumatic life changes.

I have general anxiety triggered by any financial or logistical difficulty (e.g., new billing system for internet messes up my payment, had to call in a few times) that bleeds into the rest of my everyday life and causes feelings of panic and impending doom that starts affecting other things I do.  I must have checked that website 12-15x a day while waiting for the ""end of week' fix a customer support rep promised. 

When I'm in the middle of one of these anxiety episodes I have trouble eating (no appetite, everything tastes like cardboard) and sleeping. 

 Right now my partner and I are in the middle of a job change where we have to find a new place/state to live within 6 weeks depending on what's offered (or move back to old city I lived in for 18 years), and my anxiety is at an all time high.

&amp;nbsp;

History:

Single-parent home, one sibling.  My sibling and I got along fine, but my mother was abusive (verbally and physically) for as long as I can remember.  She would hit me for extended periods of time with anything conveniently in reach whenever I pissed her off (""talking back"", not doing chores properly, not helping her quickly enough).  This went on until I was 14 and she met a rich guy who she thought she was going to marry and live a nice life with.  At this point, my sibling who is 4 years older, had taken a vacation at my paternal grandmother's home and two weeks in, called to tell my mother they was staying with her permanently.  I was alone with my mother.  Mother asked me if I wanted to come with her (move far away) to live with her boyfriend and I said no that I wanted to stay in the city where I had grown up and gone to school.  She didn't argue or resist.  Mother was quite young when she had me and my sibling and she seemed to resent having two children with a dead father quite a bit (she would tell us how much of a financial burden we were and that my dad's grandparents never helped her (i.e., money sent) enough). 

So mother found a friend of a friend (young woman in her late 20's) that she said would take me on as a roommate, and left me with her one meeting after meeting her for the first time.  I lived in a makeshift room in that person's living room (it was a 1 bedroom apartment).

One year later she called to tell me me money had run out and she could no longer let me live with her friend's friend.  She had at this point broken up with the rich boyfriend, and urged me to live with her (she had moved in with my grandparents far away because she had no money).  I said no, and asked her if she could just come back so we could have a home together again.  She screamed abuse at me and told me I was being my usual horrible terrible self, and that if I didn't do what she wanted she didn't care where I ended up.

I ended up emancipated.

I lived with some of my friends for the last two and a half years of high school, months at a time when I tried not to wear out my welcome.  Their parents were very nice and to this day I am forever grateful that they took in a random stranger kid and fed me and gave me a bed for so long.  My high school counselor found a ""job"" in the high school counseling office that gave me $25 a week so I could buy food for lunch and dinner (I didn't like always eating at my friends' because I already felt like a burden). I lived on 1 slice pizza deals and eggs and ramen. 

I got good grades in high school and got enough financial aid as an emancipated minor to go to a university.  From then I worked as much as I could to make it back up out of being poor.  

To this day I have an overwhelming fear and paranoia of becoming poor and homeless again.  Whenever any relative-to-now small thing, such as having to spend a couple hundred dollars on an unexpected repair or medical issue, pops up, I get a massive anxiety episode that lasts for days or weeks.  Even though we have enough savings and income so that even a few thousand dollars of expense would be easily taken care of, I still live in fear of losing everything back to the point where I was 15 and homeless.

I didn't talk to my mother for over 10 years.  I talk to her now but try to keep the contact minimal.  I see her once or twice a year on holidays.  My friends and partner sometimes tell me i should just not talk to her, because she hasn't changed, but at her older age I feel pity for her (she's poor (never was good with working a steady job or saving, everyone in the family thinks she has mental health issues) and barely able to make ends meet).  So I try to maintain a minimal relationship so I don't feel like I'm abandoning her.

&amp;nbsp;
Just in case it's a question, I do have other (aunts and uncles) relatives but years later I found out that they thought my mother was taking care of me remotely because they would ask about me and she would lie and tell them I was doing fine, even though we were not on speaking terms.  I thought for years that they just didn't care.

&amp;nbsp;
Conclusion/Questions:

1. Given that this anxiety appeared after moving across the country, could it be possible that it will disappear if we move back? (job circumstances are such that we are being requested to move back by my partner's company).  I am not happy in the new city we live in so I would be happier moving back where it feels safe and familiar.

2.  It has been suggested to me by my sibling, friends, and partner that I should get on anti-anxiety medicine like Lexapro because they can see my anxiety is crippling my everyday life.  How hard is it to get off Lexapro?  I'm afraid of having to be on it for the rest of my life.

3.  Can I overcome this anxiety without medication by talking to a counselor/psychologist?  I know I have abandonment/abuse/trauma issues which I thought I had overcome via counseling after college, but now I feel like I've circled back to the same emotional state I was in before.

First of all I am proud of all of you who have learnt to fight off or are in process of learning how to fight it off!

I have learnt a LOT over the last two weeks about anxiety, I am lucky not to suffer badly from it, but an incidence happend and I would like some tips.

So 3 weeks ago we went to Belgium on holiday, visited Amsterdam, bought a cannabis brownie, the girl in the shop told me the dosis was low, so I asked for four, too expensive so I just took 2. Later on we split the brownie into 4 and I had a quarter my girlfriend had a little less than a quarter and the other half was left. After like 2 hours I hit hard, very hard, I have smoked weed and know what it's like, but my girlfriend had never smoked more than one or two puffs. So it hit me hard I got worried about her and a minute later she had a panic attack I think, she was really high so she thought she was not on earth and going to die. We got to a first aid centre I explained the situation but all tests were ok, just a little fast heart beat. After a while we got a taxi back to the hotel, she was scared of sleeping as she thought she wouldn't wake up. The brownies effect was ongoing still through the next few days. 
Back at home, she has been to the hospital as a friend is a doctor, all tests were ok. 
But every now and again she got what I suppose is an anxiety attack. But it seemed to be getting better.
3 days ago we had some food with her family and many family members had a bad stomach the next day, including my girlfriend. So these last 2 days she has had a small stomach virus but it has caused many anxiety attacks, especially when out and about, we have had to cancel plans because she wasn't feeling well. 

So that's the story up till now. 

I just want to get some concepts right and see if you can help me to help her and anyone else who is reading. 

Tight chest, fast heartbeat, suffocation feeling, tight upper back muscles, stomach pain and visits to the toilet are typical symptoms of anxiety attacks, correct?

Not taking in advice is also normal during an anxiety attack? I'll tell her the science and facts about anxiety and what she is feeling is normal, but she still thinks she is going to ""shut down"" 

I would like to know any tips you have about helping or direct tips for her, she takes a Valium only when needed as they are the best, she has seen a doctor, we are thinking about a psychologist but I don't know if it's necessary.

I don't know if I have forgotten anything hopefully not. 

Thanks for the help, and keep on fighting off or surfing off this little bug and well done to those who have learnt!!

This makes me feel pretty inadequate and un wanting to date because what’s the point when it eventually comes to intimacy and a) I can’t perform due to I rarely have sex b) just freak out and then it’s just a disaster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now looking forward rather than dwelling on the past, I am looking for suggestions on how to somehow get over this. Many of my other anxieties were dealt with by slowly dipping myself into it but with sexual issues, I don’t feel comfortable doing like a one night stand and potentially giving my partner a bad experience where I freak out or something, just not fair. I was thinking of trying to get an escort but that’s like crazy expensive and I need something more consistent to work through my issues. I’ve heard the “just talk to her she will understand” type of advice and that’s not really practical for me, I won’t feel ready to put myself out there until I can solve this issue for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

She got mad at me and started saying that I don&amp;#39;t know anything and that I&amp;#39;m accusing her of things, which I really didn&amp;#39;t mean to imply, and that I don&amp;#39;t do shit and she hates the fact that I&amp;#39;m oversleeping, but hides her anger everyday so as not to hurt my feelings. She also said that she does everything for me, and I won&amp;#39;t do the same for her in the future. And yes, I&amp;#39;m procrastinating. I&amp;#39;m scared to do a lot of things, but I try my best... do I, really? Maybe I am a goddamn egoist who likes getting on people&amp;#39;s nerves, and I just hang on my mum&amp;#39;s back cause she provides money for me. What if that&amp;#39;s true? That&amp;#39;s horrible. I don&amp;#39;t want to be bad. But I do think about myself all the time, even if not in a good way. Mom says that all that psychological stuff I know is what&amp;#39;s making me act this bad. I don&amp;#39;t really think so, but what if? I can&amp;#39;t deny I&amp;#39;m awful. Now she&amp;#39;s sad. She has her birthday tommorow. I don&amp;#39;t even have a fucking present for her. For my birthday? I bought all I wanted. For everyone else&amp;#39;s? Ooops, no money, sorry. And now I&amp;#39;m here, and I know she&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s alright, she doesn&amp;#39;t need a present, but she will be very disappointed inside, but hide it untill she just gets mad again. 
If she knew I&amp;#39;m writing all of this here, she&amp;#39;d hate me. She hates this. But I don&amp;#39;t know what else can I do. She says I&amp;#39;m a lazy coward and she&amp;#39;s right. How can I do better? How...?&lt;/p&gt;

I've purchased clothes that fit me right, clothes that I'm comfortable in.. but one time last semester I had what I think was a panic attack. I started sweating like CRAZY.. like my shirt was soaked by the time I got home. This happened while in the middle of school related stuff. I was mad embarrassed.

I think I cling onto that in the back of my mind, and I'm constantly asking myself: ""Holy heck, am I sweating? is it going to be like that one time?"" then I can feel my body start to pick up.

I'm a pretty fresh dude, and I probably don't need to apply so much antiperspirant but I get worried I'm just going to sweat like mad. In fact, I want to swap off antiperspirant as it leaves white streaks on certain clothes if they're too dark.

I know clothing material is important. I feel comfortable in clothes with colors or materials that wouldn't really 'show' if I just went on a sweat-streak... but I don't want to limit my life.

May I have some advice from those experienced, maybe I can get a handle on it for once...

What I usually do:

* Slow my pace between classes, don't be in such a hurry (I like wind-sprint stairs).
* Arrive to class early, before others get there so I can ""cool-off"" without feeling the ambient 'warmth' of others around me
* Remove sweatshirts/jackets in the winter, don't see too closed off in the summer.
* Go to the bathroom and take some deep breaths, dip my face in cold water, run cold water on my wrists for a bit.
* (Funny as it sounds) I avoid looking at myself in reflections, such as mirrors/windows.

Flash forward to this year- I haven’t had a panic attack or anything more than very mild anxiety in almost a year. My therapist encourages me- this is your year.
I sign up, I pay my dues, I buy all the necessary stuff, I make travel plans, I pack my bags, I get in the car with my close friend to hit the road...
And then the soul crushing panic attack hit. And for the first 5 hours of the road trip I held out in hopes it would calm down. I took my Xanax I have in case things get bad, I focused on breathing- but nothing helped.

I broke up with my ex quite a while ago and I'm completely over it, but because of how much he hurt me in my past, I have a hard time seeing him at work

When I started this job I didn't know that he worked there. I was dealing with it just fine until they moved him a couple cubicle isles away from me after I asked for them not to do that. He doesn't even work on the same client as me. It was too close for comfort and I kept wanting to tell him to stfu when I'd hear him talk. It was distracting me at work so I switch to night shift. After that our client's office moved to the second floor so I switched back to days.

Now it's like I see him once in awhile and I don't say anything. It's because of all the stuff he put me and my current partner through (he threatened to fight my current partner multiple times after the break up  and when I was still with my ex he threatened to kill himself when I tried to leave so I was trapped).  I don't think he's fully gotten over it like I have. Whenever I see him I become frozen and feel like I can't talk or breathe. when I'm outside on my breaks I wear my shades so I can avoid direct eye contact. And I'm praying in my head that he won't try to talk to me since I already told him once to not speak to me after the first time he tried to at work. 

Not avoiding him because I'm scared, I just have higher standards and don't like to be around a piece of shit who triggers bad memories just by me looking at him. I've been dealing with it a lot better and I just keep to myself and do my job cuz that's what I'm there for, but it's just hard sometimes. There were days I had to take an anti anxiety med because of it. I have to force myself to ignore the flash backs and I'll call my man when I'm anxious or listen to music. I've developed some coping methods.

Anxiety is wanting to curl up in a ball, but feeling claustrophobic when you do. Anxiety is wanting help, but being afraid to speak up. Anxiety is knowing something is wrong, but not knowing why. Anxiety is feeling tense for no particular reason. Anxiety is feeling short of breath, but not always requiring you to gasp for breath. Anxiety is having tons of boxed up energy, but nowhere to release it. Anxiety is clenching and unclenching your hands in hopes that it will bring you stability. Anxiety is knowing that things will get better, but forgetting it in the moment. Anxiety is crying after being told too much at once. Anxiety is not being believed. Anxiety is easily hidden to all except those you know best, and sometimes even from them. Anxiety is starting to shake, until you can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. Anxiety is not knowing what is wrong with you, but knowing something isn&amp;#39;t quite right. Anxiety is nervously chattering in hopes that nobody notices your pain. Anxiety is suddenly withdrawing from everyone for no reason. Anxiety is feeling hopeless. Anxiety is feeling alone, but not lonely enough to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

Certain places we would go to hangout, music we listened to together, etc all bring out major anxiety when I am reminded of it because it reminds me of the people and the time which I am trying so hardly to forget and move on from.

Hey all! I'm currently in the midst of a fairly intense episode of anxiety and I don't have any good strategy to get out of it.  
I'll give a little background of how my anxiety generally affects me and explain where I'm at and how I could use some help.  
Mine is definitely not an everyday anxiety. It usually hits in situations surrounding friends and relationships. So  I guess social anxiety. I haven't seen  therapist so I don't know accurately. Things like waiting for responses about making plans absolutely trigger me. It can range from ""people don't want to hang out with me"" to ""what if something happened to my friend??""   
Which is where I'm at right now. A friend of mine broke up with their SO a couple days ago because they were uber controlling / uncaring. We were making plans to hang out via text and it's been less than a day since I sent my message, but I guess that was enough. I woke up in a mess of an anxiety episode and I'm on the verge of tears because I'm worrying so much about my friend.  
I know I just need to be patient and wait for a response but this feeling is awful. Woke up super early couldn't go back to bed, I'm full of energy even though I feel like I need to sleep my hands are sweaty I can't stop bouncing my leg and this sucks. I'm supposed to go hang with my family today, but if this doesn't go away there's no way I'm doing that.  
What do you find helps you when you know you're having an intense episode of anxiety? 

I have one strat but it's not that great. I tell the person that I have anxiety and that I could really use a response in this moment. But then I'm still left waiting you know? :/  


  
Also I'm not sure if this breaks rule 5. I'm not looking cures or diagnosis. Just what helps you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Possible trigger warning]  &lt;/p&gt;

I’m estimating that I created a MySpace during 8th grade in 2005. I’ve always had public social media accounts because I didn’t think I had much or anything to worry about. However in 2009, (Im pretty sure this was the year because I remember what picture was stolen, but I don’t remember what year I started using Facebook so I could be wrong) someone sent me a message from another MySpace account using my name and my photo as their profile photo. The message said, “Why are you pretending to be me?” This is the first of what I didn’t expect to be a decade long situation involving some random person stealing my pictures and making fake social media accounts using either my name or a name very similar to mine. 
I didn’t know why anyone would do that. Now I’m older and realize that this person got caught up using my real name and the person he or she was catfishing called him or her out on it so they sent me that message to prove they were real. It shocked the hell out of me and it was really bizarre and creepy to feel creeped out about my own photo smiling at me- as if it were another person completely. I remember responding. I don’t remember what I said. I do remember reporting the account as fake and having to send Tom or Tom’s henchmen a picture of myself holding a piece of paper with my URL on it in order for them to be able to delete the account. The account got deleted and I continued my life never thinking about that moment again. Not til more recently that is.

It took me a long time to remember that it happened. Why would I dwell on it? Would you have? I obviously didn’t. 
During my high school days, I was very active on Tumblr. I would come home every day from school and just scroll through Tumblr and talk on AIM until I got tired and wanted to go to bed. I’d blog about random things that happened in my my life and post pictures of myself and other things I wanted to share. I’d reblog things I thought were cool- usually artsy photographs or something interesting that had to do with science or pictures of some art I created. I had a pretty good following. People would ask me for relationship advice. I don’t know why. Maybe they thought I would be good for that. Long story short, I was very very active on Tumblr and MySpace. I’d post A LOT and was very open to sharing photos of myself and my hobbies. 

Years pass and I’m gonna say when I was about 21 years old, 7-8 years ago, one of my best friends texted me and said something along the lines of, “Hey, I think someone is catfishing with your pictures.” He sent me a link to a Tumblr blog. I remember looking at this blog with my jaw hanging wide open the whole time. I remember asking him how he found that blog. He told me he had been following it for a few YEARS thinking it was mine and he didn’t think it wasn’t me until a post he or she made that day. It said something about how he or she was high or wanted to smoke another joint or bowl or something. I just remember it had something to do with weed, which I didn’t smoke anymore.

I scrolled through the whole blog and was shocked and disgusted to see that this person had stolen, posted, and reposted my pictures from the past 6 years back to my MySpace days. By that time, I know I had moved onto Facebook and Instagram and I’d post a lot there as well. On this blog, every time I’d share something on social media, this thief would repost it and slightly change the captions. I remember being offended by one of the videos he or she reposted of me. I was talking in the video. In the caption this person re-wrote, he or she apologized for MY annoying voice. Whenever I tell people that, they laugh, but I still feel the same about it- What the hell man?? Not cool! How you gonna steal my whole face and body and personality and then diss my voice. Ugh, I hate this person. 

Anyway, I got that account deleted too. I remember that I kept checking after I reported it to see if it was still up &amp; then the relief of seeing that weird spinning disco ball and white text that said, “There’s nothing here.” &amp; I don’t know why, but I still never made the connection to that fake MySpace account that messaged me years ago. I should have been smarter and that should have made me more cautious just openly posting my life on the internet. I should have known by then to make my social media accounts private.  I was young. I didn’t care. I didn’t remember. I was stupid.

For whatever reason, I thought it was over. I thought that by deleting the accounts, it was over each time. Unfortunately, each time I was wrong.

That Tumblr discovery happened around 2011. You already know this but for time frame sake and this story, I’ll just remind you it is now 2019. A couple years ago, an old coworker of mine sent me a DM telling me he found a dating account on Plenty of Fish someone made using my photos. He or she used a name only one letter different from my own and said they lived in the same city I live in. I got it deleted of course and again for whatever reason I thought that’d be the end of it. However this time, I was actually a little smarter because I got worried that they were trying to catfish people in my area. I thought to myself that if they catfish someone in my area and the catfished got frustrated or angry that fake me never wanted to meet, they’d hate me and then end up seeing me in public with my actual boyfriend and end up murdering me. So I set my social media accounts to private. Finally right? Ugh. I’m dumb. I should’ve done that 10 years ago. I remember posting about this fake dating profile and one of my followers replied and told me he thought he was dating me online for a while but found my real account and realized he was we bamboozled. What?! Weird!!

I had almost 2000 followers on Instagram at the time (mostly people I didn’t know so it was hard to narrow down which of my followers was stealing my pictures again.) I have a love hate relationship with Instagram so I’d temporarily disable it a lot. But one time I disabled it and was never able to log back in, which in hindsight is probably a good thing because I probably would have kept it up leading to an inevitable mental breakdown due to my own self induced anxiety that one of my followers was a psychotic cyber stalker. &amp; either I can’t remember changing the password or someone changed my password but I still have never been able to log back in. I know it hasn’t been deleted completely because I can’t take my old username. It says it’s in use but when you search for it, it doesn’t exist.

I had an account I created before this one I loss access to, but I decided to start fresh. The older one was private and inactive so I just left it hanging out in limbo and made a new one- Instagram numero tres aka my current Instagram.

So that POF account finding was a few years ago and since then I haven’t heard about any more fake accounts. I don’t remember initially finding a fake Twitter in my name when, but recently I was scrolling through my twitter deleting dumb posts I made and I saw a tweet I made to a twitter that stole my name and photos in 2017.  The handle was my first and last name with no spaces and a picture of me on Halloween but I didn’t create the account. I found that tweet I forgot I made 12 weeks ago according to my Instagram story highlight. Yep- a highlight on my IG dedicated to the fake profiles that I find on the internet. I thought the fake Twitter was still active but I checked just now and it says the account has been suspended. When I found this Twitter, I posted to my Instagram story that a fake twitter exists in my name with my photo but it isn’t me. A friend responded and told me about another fake dating profile on OKcupid. He said that he always reports fake profiles he sees on dating apps using my photos! I said wait how many have you found? He told me he wasn’t sure but he’s seen them often and he always tries to match with them but it never works. Apparently he’s not my stalker’s type. 

I went on OKcupid and I found the profile he mentioned. This psycho stole a photo off my boyfriend’s Instagram because he or she had nowhere else to steal from! My boyfriend barely posts and they took the one picture that was still publicly available to steal! 

That’s weird and totally unnerving that this fake profile thing is a never ending dilemma I apparently just have to put up with my entire life because this person has mountains of photos they can use to create fake relationship after fake relationship. I try not to think about this cyber stalker but ONE WEEK AGO I was reminded by an email. Remember that old Instagram I have that I said was hanging out in limbo? Well I got an email that said someone was trying to log into it. To me, it’s obvious that there is a really good chance that it’s the same person.

While on the verge of falling asleep the other night, I had an anxious thought: If I keep my social media private, then the fake profiles have free range to galavant as me on the internet and the catfished will never be able to discover that this person is a fraud because they’ll never find the real me. That terrifying thought led to another and another and so I deleted most of my personal photos aside from pictures of myself and my boyfriend and I set my profile to public again. 

I shared my thoughts about my anxiety with my friends and one asked how long this has been going on and it wasn’t til just now that I remembered 10 years ago I received my first message from my obsessed anonymous stalker. This has been going on for 10 years and who knows how many people this person has catfished during that time. 

Every time I find another fake dating profile, I share it on my IG story and all my friends are always surprised by how long this has been going on. I don’t think anyone can imagine what it feels like to be in such a bizarre situation. 

I know this was a long story, but if you made it this far, I guess I’m just asking for advice on what you guys would do to cope with the anxiety and constant fear of being kidnapped or murdered by an angry cyber stalker that no longer has any current pictures of me to steal. I always think about who this could possibly be and why they have been doing this for so long. Why me? Is he or she hiding in my closet? Is there anyone else they’re doing this to? Why do they say they live in the same area as me and work a job similar to mine? Does this person love me or hate me? Are they TRYING to scare me or make me miserable? I feel my anxiety constantly stacking up on itself. I get anxiety about my anxiety.
Is there any input on how I can find out once and for all who this is so I can finally have some sort of piece of mind on this situation? Can anyone relate to any of this?

I feel like I have a duty to warn people, especially young people, that this is an ongoing problem that I heavily suffer anxiousness from so they can do their best to be cautious and avoid this happening to them too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m currently 28 years old. I’m estimating that I created a MySpace during 8th grade in 2005. I’ve always had public social media accounts because I didn’t think I had much or anything to worry about. However in 2009, (Im pretty sure this was the year because I remember what picture was stolen, but I don’t remember what year I started using Facebook so I could be wrong) someone sent me a message from another MySpace account using my name and my photo as their profile photo. The message said, “Why are you pretending to be me?” This is the first of what I didn’t expect to be a decade long situation involving some random person stealing my pictures and making fake social media accounts using either my name or a name very similar to mine. 
I didn’t know why anyone would do that. Now I’m older and realize that this person got caught up using my real name and the person he or she was catfishing called him or her out on it so they sent me that message to prove they were real. It shocked the hell out of me and it was really bizarre and creepy to feel creeped out about my own photo smiling at me- as if it were another person completely. I remember responding. I don’t remember what I said. I do remember reporting the account as fake and having to send Tom or Tom’s henchmen a picture of myself holding a piece of paper with my URL on it in order for them to be able to delete the account. The account got deleted and I continued my life never thinking about that moment again. Not til more recently that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to remember that it happened. Why would I dwell on it? Would you have? I obviously didn’t. 
During my high school days, I was very active on Tumblr. I would come home every day from school and just scroll through Tumblr and talk on AIM until I got tired and wanted to go to bed. I’d blog about random things that happened in my my life and post pictures of myself and other things I wanted to share. I’d reblog things I thought were cool- usually artsy photographs or something interesting that had to do with science or pictures of some art I created. I had a pretty good following. People would ask me for relationship advice. I don’t know why. Maybe they thought I would be good for that. Long story short, I was very very active on Tumblr and MySpace. I’d post A LOT and was very open to sharing photos of myself and my hobbies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years pass and I’m gonna say when I was about 21 years old, 7-8 years ago, one of my best friends texted me and said something along the lines of, “Hey, I think someone is catfishing with your pictures.” He sent me a link to a Tumblr blog. I remember looking at this blog with my jaw hanging wide open the whole time. I remember asking him how he found that blog. He told me he had been following it for a few YEARS thinking it was mine and he didn’t think it wasn’t me until a post he or she made that day. It said something about how he or she was high or wanted to smoke another joint or bowl or something. I just remember it had something to do with weed, which I didn’t smoke anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scrolled through the whole blog and was shocked and disgusted to see that this person had stolen, posted, and reposted my pictures from the past 6 years back to my MySpace days. By that time, I know I had moved onto Facebook and Instagram and I’d post a lot there as well. On this blog, every time I’d share something on social media, this thief would repost it and slightly change the captions. I remember being offended by one of the videos he or she reposted of me. I was talking in the video. In the caption this person re-wrote, he or she apologized for MY annoying voice. Whenever I tell people that, they laugh, but I still feel the same about it- What the hell man?? Not cool! How you gonna steal my whole face and body and personality and then diss my voice. Ugh, I hate this person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got that account deleted too. I remember that I kept checking after I reported it to see if it was still up &amp;amp; then the relief of seeing that weird spinning disco ball and white text that said, “There’s nothing here.” &amp;amp; I don’t know why, but I still never made the connection to that fake MySpace account that messaged me years ago. I should have been smarter and that should have made me more cautious just openly posting my life on the internet. I should have known by then to make my social media accounts private.  I was young. I didn’t care. I didn’t remember. I was stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I thought it was over. I thought that by deleting the accounts, it was over each time. Unfortunately, each time I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Tumblr discovery happened around 2011. You already know this but for time frame sake and this story, I’ll just remind you it is now 2019. A couple years ago, an old coworker of mine sent me a DM telling me he found a dating account on Plenty of Fish someone made using my photos. He or she used a name only one letter different from my own and said they lived in the same city I live in. I got it deleted of course and again for whatever reason I thought that’d be the end of it. However this time, I was actually a little smarter because I got worried that they were trying to catfish people in my area. I thought to myself that if they catfish someone in my area and the catfished got frustrated or angry that fake me never wanted to meet, they’d hate me and then end up seeing me in public with my actual boyfriend and end up murdering me. So I set my social media accounts to private. Finally right? Ugh. I’m dumb. I should’ve done that 10 years ago. I remember posting about this fake dating profile and one of my followers replied and told me he thought he was dating me online for a while but found my real account and realized he was we bamboozled. What?! Weird!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had almost 2000 followers on Instagram at the time (mostly people I didn’t know so it was hard to narrow down which of my followers was stealing my pictures again.) I have a love hate relationship with Instagram so I’d temporarily disable it a lot. But one time I disabled it and was never able to log back in, which in hindsight is probably a good thing because I probably would have kept it up leading to an inevitable mental breakdown due to my own self induced anxiety that one of my followers was a psychotic cyber stalker. &amp;amp; either I can’t remember changing the password or someone changed my password but I still have never been able to log back in. I know it hasn’t been deleted completely because I can’t take my old username. It says it’s in use but when you search for it, it doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an account I created before this one I loss access to, but I decided to start fresh. The older one was private and inactive so I just left it hanging out in limbo and made a new one- Instagram numero tres aka my current Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that POF account finding was a few years ago and since then I haven’t heard about any more fake accounts. I don’t remember initially finding a fake Twitter in my name when, but recently I was scrolling through my twitter deleting dumb posts I made and I saw a tweet I made to a twitter that stole my name and photos in 2017.  The handle was my first and last name with no spaces and a picture of me on Halloween but I didn’t create the account. I found that tweet I forgot I made 12 weeks ago according to my Instagram story highlight. Yep- a highlight on my IG dedicated to the fake profiles that I find on the internet. I thought the fake Twitter was still active but I checked just now and it says the account has been suspended. When I found this Twitter, I posted to my Instagram story that a fake twitter exists in my name with my photo but it isn’t me. A friend responded and told me about another fake dating profile on OKcupid. He said that he always reports fake profiles he sees on dating apps using my photos! I said wait how many have you found? He told me he wasn’t sure but he’s seen them often and he always tries to match with them but it never works. Apparently he’s not my stalker’s type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on OKcupid and I found the profile he mentioned. This psycho stole a photo off my boyfriend’s Instagram because he or she had nowhere else to steal from! My boyfriend barely posts and they took the one picture that was still publicly available to steal! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s weird and totally unnerving that this fake profile thing is a never ending dilemma I apparently just have to put up with my entire life because this person has mountains of photos they can use to create fake relationship after fake relationship.

Within the past year my anxiety has worsened to become much more noticeable and a problem, I’ve been having racing thoughts and often ruminate. For example, I will even think about stuff from years ago, or randomly think about if I filed my taxes right, which will lead to other thoughts that I can’t push out. I occasionally have panic attacks. 

For a little over a month I’ve been going to a therapist, which has helped it a bit. Still don’t know what my problems are, seems to be consistent with GAD. The therapist hasn’t told me what he thinks it could be classified as. That was my assumption. 

Anyways, yesterday I was prescribed Clonazepam (was going to be prescribed Xanax, but said I preferred Valium) 0.5 mg to break in half and take 3 times a day as needed. First day I was not impressed. Today, the second day, I took .25mg in the morning then .25mg at around 4 then .25mg at about 9:30. I’ve felt great today haven’t worried about much. No racing thoughts, I didn’t think anyone was judging me and felt normal and more confident. 

*The first day the Clonazepam made me feel weird and not good, like it didn’t work and I felt foggy. Note: I have taken Valium and Xanax a couple times before.

I’m not sure if I’m taking it as the NP thinks would be as needed but I deal with these racing thoughts and anxiety nearly everyday, and I have a 45 tablet script so I might be taking it to prevent the symptoms. Rather than as they come.

WHAT IM WORRIED ABOUT

If I take it every day, not increasing the dose. Will I become physically dependent on it.? The Nurse Practitioner that prescribed it told me, when I asked about this, that I should not have a problem down the road and most of her patients think that it’s wonderful and haven’t had issues getting off. I don’t necessarily believe this, from the stories I’ve heard. Should I be worried? Is this going to lead me down a bad path?

I hope not because it really seems like it could help me. Clonazepam calms my mind but doesn’t completely relax me like my brief experience with Valium; but that’s fine, peace of mind is what I’m looking for.

I would really like to hear others experiences or any advice that you can give.

I've never worked in this kind of retail before so I'm still pretty new with the products and am trying my best to learn about them, but there's always a customer who comes in and asks a question I have no idea how to answer. My social anxiety can get pretty bad so it's already challenging to approach the customers so forcefully, let alone try and persuade them to make a sale/add more items to their sale. My manager who's training me always emphasises upselling and trying to get the customer to sign up to our members program, which also makes me really anxious as to me when a customer says no the first time, I tend to just want to leave them alone, but we're really supposed to push it and try and convince them to join (its part of our KPIs). I hate making people annoyed or angry so this really makes me feel awful. I'm so anxious about going into my next shift on Monday and it's only Saturday, I can't stop thinking about it and its ruining my weekend.

Over the past two weeks give or take, I've been finding it hard to fall asleep because of just thinking of the hundreds of possible things that could be wrong with me and could go wrong. It's gotten worse the past 2-3 days as well. My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and it has made me even more anxious because it makes my fears seem more rational which they obviously aren't.

Anyway, figured I'd chronical some of the things that have been keeping me up at night recently and would really appreciate any support and tips to remedies these feelings.

- Last night I couldn't sleep because I feared I had melanoma, because I remembered a scaly spot on my head which I had in 2015.

- About 4 nights ago I couldn't sleep because I feared I had MS because of a little neck shock that I got.

- Just about every night for the past 2 weeks I've been up fearing that either A. my house was going to burn down, or B. I was going to be killed by a serial killer.

Also I feel like I should note that I've been having occasional nightmares regarding being involved in a school shooting, because my school had a code red toward the end of the school year last year (false alarm trip) that lasted for about 40 minutes and was completely dreadful for me.


Since I have never really posted on this sub before, I would also like to ask questions about 2 things that are at least annoying and sometimes really dreadful.

1. I have recently been doing a lot of summer homework which means a lot of writing. The past week or so I have been feeling increasingly aware of my pencil rubbing against the skin in between my thumb and finger, which causes discomfort, which causes anxiety, which causes me to notice it more. Any tips to get around this type of thing?

2. When school comes back around, I expect this to be a problem again: I found myself getting occasional stomach pains similar to gas cramps at the beginning of last school year. Toward the end of the year I started getting anxious more, which caused me to get more stomach pains, which just in turn caused more anxiety, leaving me in a cycle of pain. Does anyone else get these gas-crampish pains from their anxiety?


Sorry for the long post that probably jumps around a lot but I wanted to mention everything anxiety related in one post instead of needing like 3-4.

Certainly a group of months to forget you would supposedly think however in a way this time period came to be one of the fundamental chapters in the book of my life.

Many people resort to a particular moment when they started feeling different, becoming more sad and increasingly more thoughtful of the worst. The truth is that this isn't due to a particular day, month or year. I can look at November 2018 and mislead you to believe that my anxiety started then. The reality is that there has been a collection of moments spanning from weeks, to years that have lead to this trojan horse of emotion. 

I look back at my youth (7-13). I used to move schools a lot, check. 

(13-17) I lost friends many friends because I lied a lot, constantly thinking how I could fuck up good relationships, FOMO, thinking about girls, losing girls online, shyness, lack of responsibility, no physical activity, no interest in school work, only interest in gaming, losing friends through gaming, Always checking what my friends are posting on instagram, terrible diet

When you are in your youth, your brain is developing. Particular events happen which has no meaning to you then but later on effects you further down the line. You may call this the Butterfly effect. Reality is often hurtful but in a way my anxiety was always going to happen due to the trauma I often unconsciously caused myself. Losing friends and making friends again. This is a traumatic experience as relationships is one of the fundemental aspects of being human. Of course you may call yourself an introvert however even you will hold a relationship, whether that be with your parents or the store owner down the road. Losing good relationships is most definitely one catalyst.

With anxiety though, it is often the case that you won't be able to actually point to one particular moment which caused it as it is a buildup over years. 

In November I started my first job, 17 years of age and no previous mental health problems. Over my first few weeks I became obsessive over the thought that I might be homosexual despite only being interested in girls over the span of my existence. I can go into detail as to what I thought, how the thoughts even appeared however I'm sure you have heard it all before. The point is that it was an anxious thought. It never meant anything to me until that point. And it hurts me just as your thoughts hurt you.

Routines.

To put it into more context, to get over anxiety is to be in a routine. My mother often comes to me asking almost daily questions like ""did you often feel sad in the mornings?"" and I always tell her that routines saved me. I cannot stress this enough. When I was at my worst point I had to keep a routine. I started going to the gym every 2-3 days, I started eating better and caring for myself, awaking at set times every morning, I started reading. Albeit half of 1984 but I started reading. The point is that I was responsible for myself for the first time in my life. I cared about who I was and what I was doing. 

*You have to care for yourself before you can care for others*

Although I stayed with my anxiety long after introducing this system, you have to let the anxiety happen, you are tired. start taking care for yourself and accept the feeling because everyone will experience it within their lives. The ones who aren't with us today are the ones who couldn't accept it. It is about doing what you can in the moment and if you can start living by each day as opposed to thinking about when you will be better, it will slowly fade from existence and you will be living happier and healthier for it. 

I am a few months rid of anxiety and its terror however, with my new implemented self-care system, I am ready for round two if it decides to step in the ring with me again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 2018 - May 2019.

For me, anxiety and sentimentality are very closely-linked. It's a real struggle to be simultaneously anxious about lots of things *and* emotionally-invested in lots of things. 

I'm generally affected by people (and places) a lot, and I get ""attached"" quite easily. But not in a clingy, ""never leave me"" sort of way at all, really. After talking to my therapist a *lot* about this, we started to use the word ""empath"" to describe the way I interact with my environment. I don't mean empath in a weird, science fiction sort of way, but rather as a way of saying that I'm highly affected by the ""energy"" people and places give off, and it can result in me feeling as if I'm sort of at the mercy of my emotions a lot of the time. For example, a great night out isn't always just that for me; it's a collage of vivid mental images and deep, gut feelings of affection, longing, and an almost film-like way of processing my emotions. All these feelings rush into my head in a kind of cluster of intense melancholy and it gets really overwhelming to process it all. On top of having GAD, additional anxiety comes into play during times of change and transition. When I feel like I can't hold on to those moments/phases that have had a profound effect on me, I get overwhelmed and panicky. 

Now, I guess I'm not necessarily *upset* that I'm this way. It's great for things like making music, writing, making friends and having meaningful conversations; but the problem is, it feels like there isn't always room in ""real life"" for this sort of... emotional vulnerability? Sometimes I just wanna be unnafected by things, and I'm so envious of people who are able to go through life without this level of sentimentality. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, so does anyone have any strategies?

I’ve been working for the same company for the past 11 years. When I entered that building for the first time I started to have severe head pressure and heat, sweating, wanting to escape (actually locked myself in the bathroom to avoid people), awkwardness while speaking to others where I avoided eye contact felt my stomach tightening and just overall wasn’t comfortable with who I was or what I said. This whole concept of working in a confined space and coming to the same place and people over and over was sheer pain. 

I didn’t know at the time that it was social anxiety. Didn’t understand why I would be extremely obsessed with what I said at work and what people might have thought about my behavior. I ruminated and felt pain all over my body after work. These seemed to be something strange about how my body felt like this after taste or this venom in my body which 11 years later I realized was stress or anxiety hormones.  

After I suffered from health crisis due to panic attacks in 2012 while being stressed with work’s tremendous social anxiety and trying to get a degree I found myself in the ER more than I can remember, now I have a couple of years of memories that I can’t access due to those traumatic health scares and extreme anxiety, social, generalized and examination related. This was the first peak of my anxiety crisis 

In 2015 I went on I got promoted to this job where I have to speak to a large number of people on daily basis, especially people in authority positions. A job that people want was a daily torment to me. The sheer load of work on top of how difficult it was to do the tasks without any experience, adding to that the tremendous social anxiety, performance anxiety, generalized anxiety, my depression and past trauma being a repeated sexual abuse victim when I was a teenager and growing up with an emotionally abusive mother, being a child of poverty and father abandonment, all of that bombarded me psychologically.

I hit despair more than I can count. I thought that death is the only way out. I saw few therapists that I didn’t trust or didn’t have the intelligence to treat me as an intellectual, just writing me pills and sending me to a psychologist. I decided against medication, maybe because I feared the health consequences since I was having healthy anxiety crisis every day. I didn’t drink either. 

I kept standing, I didn’t buckle under all of this, because the child in me who suffered in the past needed the life that I promised him, the life of getting out of misery and doing something purposeful. I lost my spiritual ground because I developed religious phobia driven by a strong fear mortality caused by the 2012 health panic attacks. 

In 2017 onwards and amid all of this, a question kept nagging me. What gives power to all of these anxiety triggers? Why am I terrified when I meet my boss? Why do I fear entering the work building? Why do I get nervous meeting my work team? Why some people don’t make me anxious at all? Why some places at work or the mall nearby my house (where I had a panic attack few times) or some time during the night all make me anxious why others didn’t? 

I started writing extensively, just free writing what comes to my mind trying to answer these questions and I started making lists of what makes me anxious and rate them. 

I discovered that what makes me anxious is specific people, specific places, specific thoughts and subjects. 

Then I read about CBT on my own and I understood the basic idea of it. Unhelpful thoughts cause negative emotions. And unhelpful thoughts are brought up due to unhelpful beliefs installed in you by years and years of bad parenting, bad schooling, bad social constructs, and most importantly bad mental chatter that drips day after day year after year and form this pool of tar in your mind where all of these negative or dark thoughts come from. 

With CBT a revaluation came to me, which is hidden beliefs give these triggers the power to bring on anxiety as a reaction. It’s not just about thoughts. For example I automatically get an anxiety response in specific places in the company even when there is no one around. I called that contextual anxiety, or anxiety that is triggered because something happened in that place that caused anxiety before, not because of something that is happening now. Same with depression, some places, songs, people, thoughts, tv shows and what not all can trigger a depression response. 

I became a personal detective trying to unravel these beliefs, which is not easy to do. They’re hidden and you can’t access them, but you can access thoughts that pop in your head from time to time. So whenever a negative thought pops in my mind, I take note of it whenever I catch it. Then it became a habit to do so. I noticed that there is a repetition in these random thoughts surfacing, and they seem to solidify some belief underneath. 

A meditation mental tool called “noting” helped me here a lot to do so. I note or label the thought or the feeling. I merged that with CBT, so I will label and challenge the negative thought in my head or while writing. 

I kept on digging to what sort of belief would make me think “I would never be able to pull off that presentation” or “my boss thinks I’m useless and be will replace me soon” or “I can never become anything in the future” or “there is nothing in the future but death and a cold winter of loneliness”. 

Low self worth was a belief that I unraveled. Self hate was another, or rather being deserving of misery (because I hated myself as a child and a young adult for a very long time), being not good enough, not being smart enough, being ugly, being watched all the time, and so on. 

The more I documented the anxiety events in my life especially at work and linked them to those beliefs the more I saw the patterns and created this mental network of what causes what. 

Then I was able to predict what would an anxiety event cause in advance and what sort of belief would be activated. Self talk at the moment when the anxiety is activated doesn’t help, but riding the wave until the event is over and then doing the analysis work (takes 10 minutes or a bit more) of what was the event, what were the thoughts and beliefs associated and what were the mental, physical and behavioral consequences were was more important than surviving the event. 

I noticed with time that the triggers became weaker than they were a while ago, and gradually some of the triggers just faded and became nothing to worry about. 

I recently came up with a list of 24 people who make me anxious, 3 places at work that are hot zones of anxiety and auto trigger anxiety, which made me think this building is not that bad, 24 people out of 700 people and 3 places out of 6 floors is something I can deal with one trigger at a time. 

CBT works. Exposure works. But you need to have absolute clarity about what you’re fighting here. List the triggers down. Rank them 1 for least awful 10 to panic inducing. Figure out what sort of belief inside you gives that trigger that power. 

Doing just that is not enough. You will need to face that trigger working from the least anxiety inducing to the worst in small timed and controlled experiments. Do that with your spouse or a friend or someone you trust. Journal what you felt before during and after. Keep doing that for a while and you will just know what is what and why is why. 

When you go with the mentality of facing your fear rather than trying to avoid it, your body response is different. Doesn’t mean you will just beat up your anxiety with your strong will, I doubt that works, but you will need to endure the pain and sit with it, prevent yourself from running way or using coping mechanisms (I put on earbuds, sit near the door of a meeting room, avoid eye contact, avoid going to floors in the building, avoid meeting my boss and my team and other specific people). 

Gradually you will strip all those triggers from their power.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this  might help a lot of people with anxiety and maybe depression. &lt;/p&gt;

Doesn’t mean you will just beat up your anxiety with your strong will, I doubt that works, but you will need to endure the pain and sit with it, prevent yourself from running way or using coping mechanisms (I put on earbuds, sit near the door of a meeting room, avoid eye contact, avoid going to floors in the building, avoid meeting my boss and my team and other specific people). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually you will strip all those triggers from their power.&lt;/p&gt;

But my stupid anxiety and intense emotions got me to text my ex later in February, asking if she wanted to get back together with me. Fortunately, she refused to, and I told her that I just wanted to let the feelings pour out and that I knew who was important to me now - my current girlfriend.

The second time I did this was back in April, where I couldn't help but reminisce about the old days and lose myself to depression. Once again, my emotions made me talk to my ex about being friends this time, only this time she was less reluctant. I held myself back and refused to take any further action, refused to give up on my current girlfriend, even when my ex was tempting me into going back. 

About a few days after that, my depression kicked back in and I reached out for wanting to get back with her, even though at the time I knew I didn't really want that, because I knew what was waiting for me back there. Yet my anxiety and sadness got the best of me yet again. My ex told me she hated me this time and I left her completely.

I recently confessed to my girlfriend about it and she said she didn't care about my past, and that she still loves me. That she doesn't see me as a cheater, but it's eating me up inside. I feel like I cheated, even though she doesn't see it that way, when I have always been saying that cheaters are the thing I despise the most. 

I've been bullying myself for acting like that and I don't want to think of myself as a cheater. I know I wasn't thinking straight at the time. I know it was just some texts that I now see as completely meaningless, something I subconsciously knew I didn't want even at the time, yet I needed closure for whatever reason.

This pressure is too much for me and my girlfriend is already going through her own problems. I can't talk to her about it at the moment and I don't want to feel like a cheater or consider what I did cheating.

this story is really hard for me to share. my first panic attack was two years ago, when my friend took me to a club where there was loud ‘pop those weird stuff’ music and i thought i will handle it because im extrovert and i have no problems with ppl. in there she told me we should go dance and i was like oke sure why not i love moshpiting and pogging at metal concerts. ive never had a problem with that. but this was different i hated the music i didnt feel comfortable around those people and in 5 seconds some man tried to touch me from the back and i just looked at him slapped him and ran out. i was starting to shake and cry. outside i found a spot where there was noone and i just cried and called my bf told him what happened. he calmed me and at the rest of the night i just walked around with my other friend to wait for that friend who was inside because i didnt wanna ruin her party night. ive never felt worse. 

since then i have been having alot of these attacks mostly on exhausting days or in exam time. i hate it and i dont know what to do :( ive never been to a terapeut and idk if i should get one. this would be a big step in my life because ive been depressed, anorexic and we had hard family relationships when i was younger. most of the time now i feel calm happy and finally satisfied when i moved out of home. but i guess those strong bad thoughts are still present in my brain. do you think talking to terapeut would help my panic attacks?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hei im a 21yo female and i think its about time i ask for your help... i just had another panic attack with heavy breath, stress feeling and big shaking. im at my friends sleepover so she helped me to get trough it. we have lived at unihome together so she knows what to do when i get one. &lt;/p&gt;

First off, I am so glad I have found this community! Reading through your posts and comments have been so helpful in showing me that I really truly am not alone in this, and that this is an improvable condition given enough time. 

After a long time denying it, I am admitting that yes, I do have anxiety. I think I've repressed it for a while in a desperate need to convince myself that everything was fine. I think I've always had a little glimmer of ""nervousness"" throughout my life, but in my younger years it was more teenage-hormones/being an over-analytical person than full-blown anxiety. It ramped up to what I consider really pretty ""gentle"" anxiety in my undergrad college years, usually coming in waves around concentrated stressful times (i.e. midterms and other exams/presentations). Outside of those stressful times, my anxiety would pretty much leave me alone, with the exception of social situations (the social anxiety and feeling of not being ""good/cool enough"" was real). 

In my last year of undergrad, I was in a really bad car accident that did me some pretty major damage. Since then, I've healed bodily with blessedly minor complications, but mentally I think this was the catalyst for causing my mental health to take an abrupt nose dive. It's been nearly two years now since the accident, which is a long time in my book--and it seems like my anxiety has not been getting better. If anything, it is getting progressively worse. Confusingly, the anxiety (I think) is showing itself in areas of my life that aren't even really related to my accident. I can't explain why my anxiety is so suddenly and strongly present, because there's no logical reason for it to be here and be getting worse. It don't understand why, after so much time has passed since the accident, it would continue to trigger anxiety in my present life in personal areas that are not even related to the accident. 

More on my current anxiety. It all seems like such an oxymoron to me, and I'll explain why. I have gotten over my social anxiety for the most part, and am actually really confident in who I am as a person (again, for the most part. Everyone has their off days and I have my habits of reverting back to thinking I am not ""enough"", but those days are blessedly few). I am generally very laid-back, love to laugh and make others laugh, and I am truly happy with where my life is right now. 

So, oxymoron time--despite all of these personality/character traits and self-acceptance, I an inexplicably stressed almost all the time. Unless I am with my close friends or family, or completely by myself with absolutely no work/to-do list items, I have anxiety, stress, and adrenaline running through me. I should mention that I am a female grad student, which in and of itself is a stressful program, but not meant to be constantly stressful by any means. Yet I am constantly stressed. I wake up stressed, even if I have absolutely nothing going on that day. It doesn't matter how exquisitely I plan and organize, I will be stressed from the beginning of the work day to the end of the work day, and sometimes even at night-time too, or if I am working from home. There is this constant thread of anxiety which gets more severe while I am at work, but does not ever truly lessen unless I am completely removed from anything work-related and distracted with friends/family. I genuinely love the people I work with, I love what I study and I love the career I hope is in my future, and I respect and admire my boss/mentor, who is very supportive and who does not place any unfair expectations on me or anyone else. I just do not understand at ALL why I am so anxious all the time. 

I can be sitting at my desk doing computer work during the most kick-back work day ever, or in class listening to a lecture where there is absolutely no attention/other expectations on me, yet my heart will be pounding, my adrenaline up and sweating like crazy, and my stress levels at uncomfortably high levels. Perhaps it relates back to those feelings of not feeling ""good enough"", or fear of failure/not being able to accomplish everything and make it through this program. Maybe it is fear that I am not doing enough, that I need to be doing more, and feeling like I don't have time to do it all, like I can't keep up with everyone's expectations of what I need to be doing. Or, maybe my anxiety is being caused by something completely different--I just dont understand why work/""good enough"" stress would completely consume all parts of my life so drastically, even when logically I know there is absolutely no reason to be feeling that way. Why can't I reason through this and turn this off by giving myself a stern talking-to. I know the logic, and yet my brain refuses to calm down. And how in the world is all of this caused by/related to the accident which happened so long ago? 

Whew, that felt really good to get that off of my chest. I hope any of this made sense. If you made it this far, I appreciate it beyond words. I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts on this, and your experiences/strategies that help you. I'm just not sure where to go from here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, &lt;/p&gt;

I think I&amp;#39;ve always had a little glimmer of &amp;quot;nervousness&amp;quot; throughout my life, but in my younger years it was more teenage-hormones/being an over-analytical person than full-blown anxiety. It ramped up to what I consider really pretty &amp;quot;gentle&amp;quot; anxiety in my undergrad college years, usually coming in waves around concentrated stressful times (i.e. midterms and other exams/presentations). Outside of those stressful times, my anxiety would pretty much leave me alone, with the exception of social situations (the social anxiety and feeling of not being &amp;quot;good/cool enough&amp;quot; was real). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last year of undergrad, I was in a really bad car accident that did me some pretty major damage. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve healed bodily with blessedly minor complications, but mentally I think this was the catalyst for causing my mental health to take an abrupt nose dive. It&amp;#39;s been nearly two years now since the accident, which is a long time in my book--and it seems like my anxiety has not been getting better. If anything, it is getting progressively worse. Confusingly, the anxiety (I think) is showing itself in areas of my life that aren&amp;#39;t even really related to my accident. I can&amp;#39;t explain why my anxiety is so suddenly and strongly present, because there&amp;#39;s no logical reason for it to be here and be getting worse. It don&amp;#39;t understand why, after so much time has passed since the accident, it would continue to trigger anxiety in my present life in personal areas that are not even related to the accident. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on my current anxiety. It all seems like such an oxymoron to me, and I&amp;#39;ll explain why. I have gotten over my social anxiety for the most part, and am actually really confident in who I am as a person (again, for the most part. Everyone has their off days and I have my habits of reverting back to thinking I am not &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot;, but those days are blessedly few). I am generally very laid-back, love to laugh and make others laugh, and I am truly happy with where my life is right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, oxymoron time--despite all of these personality/character traits and self-acceptance, I an inexplicably stressed almost all the time. Unless I am with my close friends or family, or completely by myself with absolutely no work/to-do list items, I have anxiety, stress, and adrenaline running through me. I should mention that I am a female grad student, which in and of itself is a stressful program, but not meant to be constantly stressful by any means. Yet I am constantly stressed. I wake up stressed, even if I have absolutely nothing going on that day. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how exquisitely I plan and organize, I will be stressed from the beginning of the work day to the end of the work day, and sometimes even at night-time too, or if I am working from home. There is this constant thread of anxiety which gets more severe while I am at work, but does not ever truly lessen unless I am completely removed from anything work-related and distracted with friends/family. I genuinely love the people I work with, I love what I study and I love the career I hope is in my future, and I respect and admire my boss/mentor, who is very supportive and who does not place any unfair expectations on me or anyone else. I just do not understand at ALL why I am so anxious all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can be sitting at my desk doing computer work during the most kick-back work day ever, or in class listening to a lecture where there is absolutely no attention/other expectations on me, yet my heart will be pounding, my adrenaline up and sweating like crazy, and my stress levels at uncomfortably high levels. Perhaps it relates back to those feelings of not feeling &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;, or fear of failure/not being able to accomplish everything and make it through this program. Maybe it is fear that I am not doing enough, that I need to be doing more, and feeling like I don&amp;#39;t have time to do it all, like I can&amp;#39;t keep up with everyone&amp;#39;s expectations of what I need to be doing. Or, maybe my anxiety is being caused by something completely different--I just dont understand why work/&amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; stress would completely consume all parts of my life so drastically, even when logically I know there is absolutely no reason to be feeling that way. Why can&amp;#39;t I reason through this and turn this off by giving myself a stern talking-to. I know the logic, and yet my brain refuses to calm down. And how in the world is all of this caused by/related to the accident which happened so long ago? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew, that felt really good to get that off of my chest. I hope any of this made sense. If you made it this far, I appreciate it beyond words. I would love to hear anyone else&amp;#39;s thoughts on this, and your experiences/strategies that help you. I&amp;#39;m just not sure where to go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

Once they’d left my school was going into a big transition turning from all girls education to a co-ed one. At this point I was struggling to find a crowd of people I really connected with like my old best friends and then I started to get bullied by three groups of girls because of my ethnicity. It didn’t originally start out as bullying, I think they meant the words as harmless insults but making me feel like a minority caused me to feel insecure and my parents complained to the teachers which then escalated the situation and caused me to become properly bullied for the rest of my education until I was 16 and left the school. Throughout those years I was also raped by a boy 3 different times who I thought I was good friends with and then he told my year group and I was slut-shamed for it. 

At this point I was so lonely and fragile and began a two year relationship when I first discovered I suffered from anxiety. My boyfriend of the time was quite selfish, involved with a lot of drugs and I always felt this notion that he hated me throughout our relationship as he always patronised me and spoke aggressively with me. Because I thought I loved him I felt sick with anxiety when he never replied to me or when I noticed a change in his tone of voice which led me to struggle with eating as I’d constantly feel sick with anxiety. I lost a significant amount of weight and would eat about a quarter of a meal a day for several months before the relationship finally ended. Through the relationship I isolated myself from making friends at my college but once it ended I finally pushed myself out of my comfort zone to find a group of friends. 

My friends from college love to party and have all known each other since they were toddlers so I still don’t feel like I fit in. Partying and drinking atmospheres make me feel very anxious and cause me to start to panic and have heart palpitations but I try and push through them just so I don’t lose my friends. All summer they’ve been asking to meet up with me and go clubbing but I’ve lied and made up so many excuses to avoid it because I can’t cope with the atmosphere after having such terrible experiences in Tenerife a few weeks ago.

I’m starting uni in September I’m worried about how to make friends and cope during freshers as I find making friends frightening in my head and it makes me feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I’m not an antisocial person at all, and have great social skills and get along with everyone I talk to just the idea of making friends makes me feel hostile as though I want nothing to do with these people Cos I haven’t found a group of close friends like from my childhood and feel I never will again.

The only way I feel comfortable and not too anxious when socialising is with my current boyfriend and whenever I meet his friends. My boyfriend also suffers from anxiety and panic attacks so I feel because we connect on that level and he can empathise with my feelings I don’t feel as anxious. When I meet his friends I feel much more willing to go out and talk to them and drink with them perhaps because I feel safe with my boyfriend by my side, or because I don’t feel committed to friendships with his friends. I don’t have to text any of them or go out of my way to see them it will be whenever my boyfriends up for it and I’ll tag along. I think my anxiety is currently driven by the idea of commitment to friendships which could fail and waste my time and constantly feeling like I’ve not found the right friendship for me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up until the age of 14 I was always popular with my year group and had 2 main bests friends who I’d spend all my time with, but both of my friends moved away and over time we became less and less in touch.

Gym class at my school is required by state law. If you want to graduate, you need at least three semesters of some kind of P.E. class. I have 2 semesters, but I just don’t know if i can do a third. The first semester of P.E. I took was my Freshman year (I’m a Senior now), and I had no anxiety about it back then. It was just another class as far as I was concerned. The second one was this summer when I took the class after the school year with like 4 other students (which was manageable for my anxiety) My fear developed during my Sophomore year when my older brother started chastising and belittling me for being so skinny (even though I’m not much skinnier than most of my peers). He judged me by his standards, which made me small and weak. So I started to believe it. Overtime I began to develop severe body image issues. It only took a few months for me to go from someone who never though much of their strength and weight, to someone who was ashamed of their build and lack of muscle mass. This made me extremely afraid to go to P.E. class because I thought that all my classmates would be laughing at me in their heads, and making fun of me for my size (which, once again, isn’t much smaller than most of my peers). I had to drop P.E. both Sophomore and Junior year because of this. I just could not bring myself to conquer my anxiety long enough to handle a 40 minute work out during the school day. It sucks because I know I’m capable of doing the workouts (lately I’ve been exercising at home and eating healthier so I’m in good shape), but I just can’t bring myself to go to class So now here I am, first semester of Senior year, still as afraid as ever of what my classmates think about me and my physical appearance. If I can’t get over this, I don’t graduate, simple as that. I’m so close though, if I can knock this class out I’m golden, I’ll graduate with honors, scholarships, and all that good stuff, but this is by far harder than any AP class or school competition that I’ve ever participated in. I’ve tried meditation, medications, talking with a therapist, talking with me school counselor, talking with my friends, I even at one point considered smoking weed and coming to school high every day.

TL:DR; would beer be a better alternative than a benzo on the hard days for anxiety. 

I’ve never drank more than a few sips of alcohol. Never been drunk and never done anything more than pot in high school. With that said I sometimes wonder if that’s how “non anxious” people are able to cope without needing ssris and other medicines. 

I’ve fallen onto hard times again and am starting Paxil for the second time. Last time was last year for 8 months then tapered off. I have klonopin .5mg for as needed and I figured after three weeks of all day anxiety I deserved a break today and it was very nice. Now that’s nice and all but I’m already afraid I’m going to get addicted if I need it in a day or two again. 

I obviously started googling everything that could help that isn’t a benzo and have always wondered if maybe an occasional beer or something would just help me relax a little and stop being so obsessed about my body, my health, and other GAD triggers.

*sorry, I’m bad at writing, I know it’s a bit all over the place, and I’m really bad at writing how I feel/think*
 
So, one of my friends has managed to borrow an apartment in Alanya (Turkey) for a few weeks. Two of my friends have already booked flights, and are leaving in a few days. 
I’ve been working on a ship for almost two weeks now and will be coming home soon (I’m really proud of myself about this, so a nice little victory for myself here hahah)
I’ve been think about going, but I didn’t have the money, but now since I’ve been working, I do. 
I was so I was excited about going. 
I found cheap flights, that kinda matched the dates of my other friends so we would have some days together. 
But now, I’m terrified. I’ve never been the big traveler, I’ve often stayed home when my family went on holiday, because I enjoy being home alone. I really want to go, because I don’t know if ill ever get a chance like this again, but I’m scared about all the things that can go wrong. I don’t like that fact I can’t communicate properly with the people there, I’ve been there before with my family and I remember not really liking it.  I’m scarred about drugs in such a different country (I don’t do it, but one of my friends does when he’s drunk)

I’m really not too scared about the days there, I think that will be fine, I’ll most likely be in the apartment with my friends having some beers and stuff, maybe go see something idk. But it’s the nights that scare me, I know my friends will want to go to a bar (don’t mind that, I love bars) and then end up in big clubs (don’t like that) and that’s where everything in my mind goes to shit, I can’t stop thinking about being mugged/drugged or anything of the sorts. Or one of my friends doing something stupid that’s gets us all in a fucked up situation. 

I always do this, I get hyped about something, and then when it’s finally about to get real I get cold feet and overthink everything and get paranoid and shit. I hate it.

I've had some anxious weeks and I just need to write it out of my system.
i'm sorry if some sentences weren't really clear, English is not my native language

I have problems with my anxiety for quite a while (10 years, 23y old). Whenever i'm outside I get these major insecurities where I get feelings that I don't even belong here. I have serious struggles to start a conversation and I feel like people think I am a moron  or just mentally disadvantaged. Some of these thoughts immediately disappear when I get back home or talk to someone who is close to me. But whenever i'm on my own I despise everything about myself. Lately I noticed i'm distancing myself away from my friends because I keep having thoughts and insecurities that i'm holding them back. My friends are  wonderful people but when I get anxious I completely freeze and am scared to talk, or at least initiate a conversation... my friends need to get me out of my mental pit so i'm at least a little bit less scared to talk again. I always feel horrible about it because I feel so needy for approval or acception, that I am scared to say anything even near my friends.

I hate these things about myself, because I don't think I will ever get happy with these thoughts which keep troubling me for so long. I have tried therapy, but after 10 terrible and awkward sessions I gave up there and had to pay a hefty amount for it.
I am honestly lost, I don't know what I should do or even try.

They started me on 200mg a night, from the get-go. Yes, my 110 pound self at age 15 started on 200mg per night.    
    
It was *awful*. I was eating until I puked, I had no emotions, I did risky things because I didn't care about consequences, I couldn't laugh or cry, I said mean things to my family for no reason, I was VERY fatigued...it just completely sucked. I felt like a sociopath. So I stopped taking it and swore it off for the rest of my life. I'm now 23.    
    
When speaking to my new psychologist, she asked what meds I've taken in the past and I made sure she wrote down that Seroquel was the WORST one and I never wanted to try it again.      
    
Fast forward 2 weeks and I was talking to the psychiatrist for the first time. She asked me about Seroquel and I told her my experience. She asked what dosage I was on and I told her they started me on 200mg. Which actually freaked her out a bit. So she explained that the reason it was so awful is because you should never start at a dosage that high. She prescribed me 25mg Seroquel *as needed* up to 3x a day. Which I did try to fight back on a bit, but she said to give it a chance and if it's bad again to just come back and we'll do something else. I think what made me feel better is if I'm feeling ok and don't want to take it, I don't have to.      
    
I'm glad I did! I took 25mg yesterday because I was starting to feel a bit panicky. And it...worked. I was still anxious, but not panicking. I also took another pill before bed and I fell asleep in about an hour. At 9PM! I haven't slept before 4AM in a LONG time.    
     
This morning I woke up feeling *good*. I felt fine. Usually I wake up having a panic attack. Every single day. And I still feel ok! I'm not shaking. I'm not freaked out over anything at all. This is amazing.     
    
I know it hasn't even been 24 hours but my bad side effects happened immediately last time. I did have the munchies last night, but I stopped eating when I was full. Which is actually a good thing because my appetite has been nonexistent and I'm pretty underweight. My restless leg syndrome was also a bit worse last night but I know how to deal with that so it was ok. Unpleasant for sure but not a huge deal.

I live in a great apartment right now, that I love, but I've found the perfect man and now I want to live with him. we've been dating for 10 months. I'm in a growing city with hosing that's currently affordable but may not be in the future, have money for a down payment, have a stable job, interest rates are really low, so I figured, hey, now's a great time to buy a house. I'm also fairly extroverted and I figured maybe I'd be more popular if I have the space to host more often. I can start inviting people to things, since around here people prefer to hang out at other people's homes.

So for months I've looked at houses, like around 5 a week, with a realtor who was in my friend group, and finally I found one that I loved. It's really big, 2k square feet for me and my boyfriend, in a cool part of town, and only slightly above budget. They were willing to come down a bit to my max budget, and we just did inspection and so far its got problems but my realtor says nothing major.

This all sounds like it's all really, really good, like my life is perfect and I got everything I wanted, but as soon as I found out that I'm getting this house, I can't stop crying. I feel nauseous just thinking about being trapped in a house for 5 years. What if it doesn't sell, or I lose money? What if my boyfriend breaks up with me and I have to live in big empty house all alone?

Even writing this post I'm crying and feel like I'm going to throw up, but I'm too deep now, I can't go back. My realtor thinks I'm insane for not jumping at this chance, I've already worked so hard finding a place, and now is the time to buy. He doesn't get paid if I don't buy so I'll be screwing him out of a whole lot of money, and given he's in our friend group this is going to have a negative affect on my social life. I've told everyone, coworkers, friends, everyone how hard I was looking and how excited I was to buy a house, and now I'll have to face everyone and tell them I've failed due to my own anxiety, and they'll all know I'm a total mess and my perfect life is all a fake. I'm not going to be able to host ever, and where am I going to live with my boyfriend? I'm sick of landlords but I also am terrified of owning things.

I have cried more in the past few months of house hunting than the past year combined, and it's all my fault. Please help I don't know what to do. Should I buy it and just deal with the fact that I feel like this, and possibly feel like this for years living there? Or should I just get an apartment with my boyfriend and deal with the social fallout and the financial mistake of throwing money away with rent, or should I move into his house way outside of town and totally destroy my social life but save money? All I want is to go back in time to May and not look at houses to begin with.

UPDATE: well, I ignored everyone's advice, including my own family, and backed out of the deal for what was probably my dream home due to my own anxieties. And I feel some combination of relief and failure. But hey, I'd rather feel like a failure and keep being a 29 year old who lives like a 22 year old than be constantly crying and feeling like I'm going to throw up. I think I'm going to move into my boyfriend's current house and ask him to buy a new house for us instead of me buying.

Luckily I took someone with me who knows how to drive for the ride back so I was able to avoid a certain crash.

to quote what I had said in a comment on my previous post:   *I stayed all the way on the right but the truck in front of me suddenly turned on their hazard.*  *I was forced to merge into the left lane but no one was making any way for me. I saw an opening and tried to catch it but the guy sped up so when I forced my way in almost hit.

I don't know what to do in that situation it's a lot of pressure at high speed.*

When I got home I just sat down in the car for about 20 minutes. I felt I just needed to give myself time to digest everything. I feel horrible about this I've lost all confidence in driving. I wish I just never passed to be honest then I wouldn't have to feel like I'm going to total myself. I'm thinking about cancelling one of my college classes so I can just pay for her uber rides until I get better at this, but I just don't even want to get behind the wheel anymore.

* Attending College (starts in September), revising/studies for three subjects
* Working in a restaurant on weekend evenings
* Listening to music
* Learning the guitar
* Politics and engagement in online debate. Love watching debates on YouTube and browsing forums
* Playing one videogame; Red Dead 2
* Cycling once, often twice, per week.

As you can see, this is easy enough to handle- right? Let's assume college starts at 9 and ends at 5 in a worst case scenario. I then have about 5 hours free time, minus eating dinner and homework I failed to do in college. This is more than enough to learn the guitar as I haven't grown the patience to play for more than 30 mins on end. Reading a forum or watching a couple of debates only takes half an hour. I would have probably listened to music on route to college etc, which leaves plenty of time to procrastinate and, if desired, go on a bike ride/play games to unwind.

Rather than just cracking on, following how I feel at the time and doing a task which suits those feelings, or following my list of daily commitments down, I just sit and worry. I am at my desk right now worrying about handling all of this, and my A-levels haven't even begun yet. This might even drive me to my end.

When I play guitar, I stress that I am not good yet.

When I play videogames, I stress that it isn't productive, even though I would have completed all my duties for that day and would be too bored to continue them even more.

I think this is down to two things; wanting to be very good at guitar (but I cannot play all the time. I have a threshold. I get bored after too long so I like to play in short sessions), and the fact life is too short. Losing my mother at 13 taught me how short life is, and rather than using that to remember to relax, I use it to stress about how little time we have on this planet, and how many skills I desire.

We pretty much just watched Markiplier for a few hours and then he drove me home. It meant a lot to me but he left the state and I haven't talked to him since.

It all gives me too much anxiety. And I'm also severely depressed and I don't want to burden anybody with either of those things. I feel like a burden to the world and I don't want to plague anybody with my presence.

I am a 21 year old university student, diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. I am a pretty shy and anxious person especially around new people, and overthink a lot . Under my psychologists advice, I made a tinder account to kind of get my self out there. I matched with this girl from the same uni and made plans to get drinks. We have only had a few conversations on snap chat and don't know much about each other.

Honestly, I feel really inexperienced and don't know what to expect. I think the plan will be to hit a bar or something. I get anxiety even being in restaurants with my friends, I don't know how bad it will get with a girl I've never met. These fears may seem stupid and they are, but I am worried about awkward silences, not knowing what to to talk about, appearing visibly nervous, other people in the bar/restaurant listening in on the conversation and ridiculing me If I am appearing awkward, or the dates not going well. I have been told I am an attractive and pleasant person but its hard to really believe. I also have zero female friends, and don't socialize much or go out. I was thinking about taking a shot before the date to ""take the edge off"" but my psychologist said that's not a good idea if I am trying to make a good first impression, which might be true (would the girl even really notice though?). I have so many questions, like do I hug her once the date is over? Say we have had our drinks and conversation, how do I say good-bye without seeming like I didn't enjoy the date or something, and that I would like to do this again? I know when grabbing a drink, if it goes well you would usually transition to get dinner or something. But honestly even if it was going well, I would rather it end there. I would rather muster up the courage next time for a longer date but for now even going to grab drinks with a stranger is a big step for me.

Anyways does anyone have any advice or tips, a similar story maybe, or anything they want to share.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 21 year old university student, diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency.

I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth.

I’ve been having a rough month with panic attacks. I’ll go through a period of 4-8 weeks where I experience panic attacks up to 3 times a week and then be completely fine for six months to a year. I understand that I am blessed to only have panic attacks three times a week, but it’s still annoying.

To give you some background information, I’m a 22F who graduated from uni in May of this year. Following my graduation, I began working as a caregiver for adults with special needs. To put a long story short, my clients were wonderful human beings, but the management horribly mistreated their employees. I ended up walking out, which I still feel guilty about. 

A week after walking out of my last job, I began working as an aide for special education students at a local high school. I’m a week in, and it’s going great! The kids like me, which I was nervous about. My boss (the teacher), is super approachable whenever I have questions, and I’m already beginning to build a rapport with other teachers and staff members at the school. 

While I was sitting with a group of students during lunch, I suddenly began to have symptoms of a panic attack. Dizziness, trouble breathing, sweating, heart racing, the whole enchilada. I got up to go to the empty classroom to catch my breath, when a coworker and my boss saw me and asked if I was okay. My boss even asked if I was having a panic attack, so clearly he’s familiar with what they look like. I nodded my head and they took me to the school nurse. I had to explain that I was an adult who works at the school because I’m young enough to pass as a student. The nurse just had me hang out until I felt well enough to rejoin my students. The whole episode, from the onset of symptoms to rejoining the group, lasted about 25 minutes. On my way back to join my students, my boss saw me in the hallway and told me that I can always step outside or take a break whenever I need to. He also asked if I was okay to finish the rest of the school day, to which I replied yes. 

I got through the rest of my day just fine, but I’m humiliated. This is not something I like to even discuss with people I work with, let alone have them see it happen. Especially after only a week. Also, I can’t figure out why it happened today. Things in my life are going great. I just graduated from college, I have a job after college, I’m in a great relationship, so what gives?

iv been an anxious person all my life, it really became noticeable and affecting my life drastically when high school started. i’m anxious to meet new people and to try things iv never tried before and a lot of the times to just speak up and talk in general. the small episodes start with a feeling in my stomach and general anxiety all the way up to my body and self completely shutting down shaking uncontrollably, not being able to move or even hear people talking to me, it feels like i’m not in control of myself and basically in a coma. this sometimes lasts for 15 minutes all the way up to an hour. 

recently i’ve started dating a girl who iv been best friends with and extremely close with for 4 years. we have tried talking and being more than friends a couple of times throughout our friendship but it never went anywhere for a number of reasons, the timing and just her not feeling that way being the major ones. two years in she did start to feel the same way but she never voiced it and i started dating another girl unknowing of how she felt. we finally decided to get our shit together and try for real after we graduated HS and it has been perfect, and has been all we’ve ever wanted (mind you iv been secretly in love with this girl throughout our entire friendship). i could go into deeper details but i think you get the point, we’re in love and believe we’re each other’s soul mates and all of that. i can’t help but get this terrible anxiety, worrying about anything ever happening to us ever breaking up or anything like that at all, and i’m worried that if i continue to be this way, always worrying about the future and asking her for reassurance quite often, is going to push her away. everything between is absolutely perfect but i can’t stop getting terrible anxiety attacks that lead to uncontrollable shaking and even puking from getting thoughts of something bad happening and us ever not being together. she can literally tell me that she loves me and i somehow will find a reason to be anxious about how she said it or any small thing that she might do, like for example me sending her a goodnight text and her not matching it how my brain believes she should. 

so i’m worried about ever losing this girl and feel like if i don’t find a way to better my anxiety with her that it will inevitably push her away more and more until she no longer wants to be with me. i truly believe she’s the one for me so i feel like this is something i have to overcome but don’t know how to.

Every single day early in the morning, I wake up to a very stressful dream. I very rarely have peaceful (neutral emotion) dreams, and I am sad to say that I have never, in my whole life, had a pleasurable, happy dream. I have had stressful dreams for as long as I can remember ( 8 / 9 years old). The most reoccuring dreams are : (1) panicking one hour before a final exam when I suddenly realize I have never gone to that class for the whole semester ; and (2) realizing I have purchased a very ugly house and I have to move from my current house I love. My dreams are never about physically painful things like be caught in a fire, or jumping in an endless hole. There are always kind-of real situations, but exagerrated x10.

I've never had panic attacks in real life or anything like that, and I'm a fairly well adjusted person with a good job, good friends and family. I am, however, always stressed that I will be fired from my job if I make the smallest mistake, or that my partner won't love me anymore when we have a trivial argument (we never really fight / yell). It might also be relevant to say that I was quite bullied in school. Especially from age 10 to 13, I had zero friends at my school, I was spending all my time (lunch, recess) alone, not at my choice. The most popular girl of the school nicknamed me ""the human garbage"". It probably affected me, even though I now have a group of very good friends. Also to be noted that I was a very hard working student. I spent all my evenings studying (from primary school to university), my goal was always to have good grades, and I was quite good, but working, I think, way too much. I am 40 years old, and female, if that matters.

Can anyone help me, or understand me?

I had severe anxiety disorder and was going to see a therapist, which actually really did help me, she was super nice and I always felt extremely comfortable around her. I had lost all my friends at the beginning of freshman year and that’s where my anxiety and depression had begun to start. I was alone at lunch every single day and I didn’t mind it until t started becoming lonely and morbid. I hated my classes because it was filled with obnoxious kids who wouldn’t let me work properly, all they did was constantly bully other kids to be funny and I had a few bad experiences of my own with interacting with my classmates that I won’t really talk about, it’s a long list. But in conclusion all of those things had started to make me spiral into this dark dark place in my mind where I began to shut down. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep, and I couldn’t talk to anyone about it because I didn’t even have friends at the time. I started to get more depressed and I figured maybe it’s because I don’t have any friends? Which is partially the reason, but the other reason was because my social anxiety started to get extremely bad to the point where I missed so much school that I was on the list of truancy. I would have panic attacks, so bad that i couldn’t breathe, my heart felt like it was going to rip out of my chest, and my hands would shake like crazy. It wasn’t that I was living in fear, or that I couldn’t ACTUALLY talk to people. People talked to me and I talked to them, but I always felt physically and mentally unable function in my school environment. I felt distracted, unable to do things, and honestly very uncomfortable. My grades were dropping, my depression was getting worse, and my anxiety was just remaining in me, and I was so frustrated that I couldn’t get it out. My depression even got so bad that I attempted suicide several times and I began to cut myself with a razor blade from a pencil sharpener. It just went on and on, until I had the courage to tell my parents. They got me help and I was able to do online schooling. It was going good in the beginning, I was getting good grades and I was able to go to atleast 2 classes at school and I was pretty comfortable, it was helping with my anxiety that I was able to take things once step at a time. It was fine until my insurance got cancelled because of some mishap that I won’t get into. 



My grades began to drop again, I was missing school again, and I also relapsed and self harmed again. I attempted suicide once more because things got so bad to be point where I wasn’t even sure if I would be able to see my therapist again. I got through it but the grades didn’t come out so good and I still wasn’t happy. It was summer and throughout the whole time I was just being told that my parents were “handling it” and that I would be able to get my insurance again because we reapplied. But we didn’t. The insurance fucked up my application process and cancelled it for no reason, we called and did everything we could to have it fixed but they messed up and the cunts got us fucked over because of it.

It was time to go back to school and that’s where the story really starts. I had a panic attack and I reached out to my mother to tell her that I was done being disappointed. Every time I put my hope in something it never helps for shit. I told her about my self harming and how I was ready to kill myself. I was doing whatever it took to just die so I wouldn’t have to go through all the pain and suffering the school system and health care system has put me through. My mother got concerned and threatened to call 911. It took a long time before I could be convinced not to have her call them. She told me I could stay at home until she talked with my school counselor and the mental health counselor. We had an appointment with them, and I was really hopeful that we could work on getting myself independent study. We got there and the first thing the counselor tells me is that HE’S GOING TO SAY HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. What the hell is the matter with school counselors? I came here to open up and put my trust in you and tell you about what I’m going through, which is scaring me because I keep thinking about hurting myself and offing myself and you’re telling me that this appointment is about what YOU WANT TO SAY and what YOU THINK IS BEST FOR ME? What’s the point of reaching out for help when I can’t actually reach out for it. 


He told me that I was still growing up, and that it was all in my head, and that it was a “phase” in which “everyone feels the same way” “everyone goes through it”. To make it even worse, the fucker told me to stand up so he could speak about what he thinks, which made me even more uncomfortable and I felt put on the spot, it made me not want to speak even more. He said that I need to find out how to “coexist” with other people around me. He acted like I was being overly sensitive or exaggerative about my anxiety. What sucks is that when opening out about social anxiety, people don’t see it as a mental illness that’s worth caring about, they see it as something minor, that you can grow out of it within time and that you’re just being shy. When I tell you that I can’t properly function, when I tell you that I can’t do my work because everything around me is heightened by a million, when I tell you that it has affected me so much that I often think I’d be better off dead because if no one can help me than there’s nothing left for me, then it’s not about growing out of my shell. There’s something wrong with my brain, I’m sick, and I need to fix it. Forcing me into an environment that I’ve tried hard to work in FOR MONTHS, isn’t going to change anything, it’s just going to become the cycle that repeats and repeats. I tried, and I tried, and I know now what’s best for me because I know how I feel. But that asshole made me feel so unwelcome that I couldn’t even have the words to say it anymore. It felt like they were making my own feelings up for me, like they were deciding for me. And my mom just stood there and agreed. 


Then the mental health counselor talked and said that “all these other kids feel the same way”. Oh really? All my classmates feel like killing themselves and harming themselves? All my classmates feel and suffer from EXACTLY what I feel and what I suffer from? She was no help either. When I asked about independent study she was acting like I didn’t need it. “You see, independent study is for people who ACTUALLY can’t come to school.” I felt so hurt, like my feelings weren’t enough. They didn’t even let me talk yet. They were still opening their big mouths. The meeting was supposed to be about what was best for ME, yet I was hardly ever able to talk during the meeting. My mom was talking about my diagnosis from my doctor and my therapist and again my counselor opens his big mouth talking about “you see when you feel like this and go to the doctor, they’ll give you all this medication and diagnose you with this and that and all these things that you really don’t have.” I was fucking furious when he said this. Who are you to doubt what I’m going through? Have you even let me talk? Have you even questioned me and asked about my feelings? No you didn’t. You’re just assuming. People don’t give a shit until you actually try and kill yourself. They don’t actually think you’ll do it until you do. I couldn’t even tell them about me wanting to hurt myself or kill myself because they made me feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome that I couldn’t confide in them. It was all about them and what they think. Not about me. You really thinking forcing me into a place that makes me a danger to myself will help me? Because believe me, it doesn’t. I went for months and months and nothing changed. They don’t know shit. And you know what’s sad? That I couldn’t even actually kill myself because the thought of my parents at risk of getting deported (they were citizens but were born in (won’t say) was terrifying. I couldn’t even go to the ER when I felt like I wasn’t in control of myself anymore because we didn’t have health insurance and apparently reaching out for help when your life is at risk costs money. And that’s why school counselors are bullshit. I’m now older and I’m doing fine at my office job, I’ve gotten help and things got way better when I was able to get back to my therapist. But one thing I would never do was go back to that shitty counselor. Don’t waste your time.
